## Replicating the Experiments

To replicate the experiments, we recommend using the instructions provided in the notebook located in the `__ColabEnvironment` directory.

If you prefer to use a local machine, you need to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (standard requirements from Google Colab plus the `scikit-learn` library).

## Used Hardware

The experiments were conducted using a Colab environment with an A100 GPU (40GB) and a Linux distribution.
