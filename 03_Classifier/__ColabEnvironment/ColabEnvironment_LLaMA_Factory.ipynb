that you can calculate the answers for each university independently of each other and sum them up to obtain the true answer The second one is that if there are students in an university then that

for each length if we know the order of and in time we can calculate k in time can be easily shown by assuming One way of doing such is using prefix doubling algorithm for suffix array construction to build a RMQ structure for query in time The prefix doubling algorithm requires precompute time Note there is still a various of ways to do this part of task in the same or better time complexties And for the shortest length part we can compute the minimal parts needed so far for each state along with the preivous dp Then compare all states ends with Overall we can solve this problem in with

For example 1 4 2 4 7 and 1 2 4 8 are beautiful but 1 2 2 2 4 and 1 3 5 3 are not Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without

element to the left less than it is equivalent to the first element is less than every other element in the sequence We can prove that these two conditions are equivalent by induction for the nd element of the sequence the only element to the left is the st so assume we have proved that for every Let s prove that Suppose that the element to the left of which is less than is if then obviously otherwise and so Using similar induction we can prove that for every element except the last one there is an element to the right larger than it is the same as the last element is greater than every other element in the sequence Since the array consists only of and we can notice that there is only one possible beautiful sequence pattern i e one followed by any number of consecutive and one final Any other pattern is invalid the leftmost element should be strictly less than every element in the middle every element from the nd to the second to last and the rightmost should be strictly greater than every element in the middle so the leftmost element should be the rightmost element should be and every element in the middle should be In order to calculate the number of subsequences that match the aforementioned pattern we can use dynamic programming Let be the number of subsequences if we have considered the first elements of the array and the current state is for example state means that the sequence is empty state means that we have taken the element equal to state means that we have taken some number of s state means that we have taken the element and the sequence is finished The transitions in this dynamic programming are pretty simple and can be done in for each state So the total complexity of the solution is\n","\n","### Response:\n","\n","label_ids:\n","[9996, 11, 57080,
