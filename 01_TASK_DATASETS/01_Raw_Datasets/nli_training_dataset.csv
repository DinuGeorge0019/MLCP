Polycarp has decided to decorate his room because the New Year is soon One of the main decorations that Polycarp will install is the garland he is going to solder himself Simple garlands consisting of several lamps connected by one wire are too boring for Polycarp He is going to solder a garland consisting of n lamps and n 1 wires Exactly one lamp will be connected to power grid and power will be transmitted from it to other lamps by the wires Each wire connectes exactly two lamps one lamp is called for this wire the one that gets power from some other wire and transmits it to this wire the other one is called the one that gets power from this wire Obviously each lamp has at most one wire that brings power to it and this lamp is the auxiliary lamp for this wire and the main lamp for all other wires connected directly to it Each lamp has a brightness value associated with it the i th lamp has brightness 2 i We define the of the wire as the sum of brightness values over all lamps that become disconnected from the grid if the wire is cut and all other wires are still working Polycarp has drawn the scheme of the garland he wants to make the scheme depicts all n lamp and n 1 wires and the lamp that will be connected directly to the grid is marked the wires are placed in such a way that the power can be transmitted to each lamp After that Polycarp calculated the importance of each wire enumerated them from 1 to n 1 in descending order of their importance and then wrote the index of the main lamp for each wire in the order from the first wire to the last one The following day Polycarp bought all required components of the garland and decided to solder it but he could not find the scheme Fortunately Polycarp found the list of indices of main lamps for all wires Can you help him restore the original scheme ,greedy,data structures

Little Petya often travels to his grandmother in the countryside The grandmother has a large garden which can be represented as a rectangle in size when viewed from above This rectangle is divided into equal square sections The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section Creating artificial rain is an expensive operation That s why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section At that the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section That is for example the garden can be represented by a rectangle where the section heights are equal to 4 2 3 3 2 Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3 the water will flow over all the sections except the ones with the height of 4 See the illustration of this example at the picture As Petya is keen on programming he decided to find such a section that if we create artificial rain above it the number of watered sections will be maximal Help him ,implementation,math

The King of Berland Polycarp LXXXIV has n daughters To establish his power to the neighbouring kingdoms he wants to marry his daughters to the princes of these kingdoms As a lucky coincidence there are n other kingdoms as well So Polycarp LXXXIV has enumerated his daughters from 1 to n and the kingdoms from 1 to n For each daughter he has compiled a list of kingdoms princes of which she wanted to marry Polycarp LXXXIV is very busy so he finds a couple for his daughters greedily one after another For the first daughter he takes and marries the daughter to their prince For the second daughter he takes If there are no free princes in the list then the daughter marries nobody and Polycarp LXXXIV proceeds to the next daughter The process ends after the n th daughter For example let there be 4 daughters and kingdoms the lists daughters have are 2 3 1 2 3 4 3 respectively In that case daughter 1 marries the prince of kingdom 2 daughter 2 marries the prince of kingdom 1 daughter 3 marries the prince of kingdom 3 leaving daughter 4 nobody to marry to Actually before starting the marriage process Polycarp LXXXIV has the time to convince one of his daughters that some prince is also worth marrying to Effectively that means that he can add exactly one kingdom to exactly one of his daughter s list Polycarp LXXXIV wants to increase the number of married couples Unfortunately what he doesn t have the time for is determining what entry to add If there is no way to increase the total number of married couples then output that the marriages are already optimal Otherwise find such an entry that the total number of married couples increases if Polycarp LXXXIV adds it If there are multiple ways to add an entry so that the total number of married couples increases then print any of them For your and our convenience you are asked to answer t independent test cases ,greedy,implementation

Suppose you have a special x y counter This counter can store some value as a decimal number at first the counter has value 0 The counter performs the following algorithm it prints its lowest digit and after that adds either x or y to its value So all sequences this counter generates are starting from 0 For example a 4 2 counter can act as follows it prints 0 and adds 4 to its value so the current value is 4 and the output is 0 it prints 4 and adds 4 to its value so the current value is 8 and the output is 04 it prints 8 and adds 4 to its value so the current value is 12 and the output is 048 it prints 2 and adds 2 to its value so the current value is 14 and the output is 0482 it prints 4 and adds 4 to its value so the current value is 18 and the output is 04824 This is only one of the possible outputs for example the same counter could generate 0246802468024 as the output if we chose to add 2 during each step You wrote down a printed sequence from one of such x y counters But the sequence was corrupted and several elements from the sequence could be erased Now you d like to recover data you ve lost but you don t even know the type of the counter you used You have a decimal string s the remaining data of the sequence For all 0 le x y 10 calculate the minimum number of digits you have to insert in the string s to make it a possible output of the x y counter Note that you can t change the order of digits in string s or erase any of them only insertions are allowed ,dp,data structures

Logical quantifiers are very useful tools for expressing claims about a set For this problem let s focus on the set of real numbers specifically There are two kinds of quantifiers universal forall and existential exists You can read more about them here The universal quantifier is used to make a claim that a statement holds For example forall x x 100 is read as for all real numbers x x is less than 100 This statement is false forall x x x 1 is read as for all real numbers x x is greater than x 1 This statement is true The existential quantifier is used to make a claim that for which the statement holds For example exists x x 100 is read as there exists a real number x such that x is less than 100 This statement is true exists x x x 1 is read as there exists a real number x such that x is greater than x 1 This statement is true Moreover these quantifiers can be nested For example forall x exists y x y is read as for all real numbers x there exists a real number y such that x is less than y This statement is true since for every x there exists y x 1 exists y forall x x y is read as there exists a real number y such that for all real numbers x x is less than y This statement is false because it claims that there is a maximum real number a number y larger than every x There are n variables x 1 x 2 ldots x n and you are given some formula of the form f x 1 dots x n x j 1 x k 1 land x j 2 x k 2 land cdots land x j m x k m where land denotes logical AND That is f x 1 ldots x n is true if every inequality x j i x k i holds Otherwise if at least one inequality does not hold then f x 1 ldots x n is false Your task is to assign quantifiers Q 1 ldots Q n to either universal forall or existential exists so that the statement Q 1 x 1 Q 2 x 2 ldots Q n x n f x 1 ldots x n is true and or determine that the statement is false for every possible assignment of quantifiers For example if f x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 then you are not allowed to make x 2 appear first and use the statement forall x 2 exists x 1 x 1 x 2 If you assign Q 1 exists and Q 2 forall it will be interpreted as exists x 1 forall x 2 x 1 x 2 ,dp,data structures

Lena is playing with matches The natural question arising in the head of any child playing with matches is whether it s possible to set a tree on fire with a matches or not Let s say that the tree is a connected graph without cycles and the vertices are labeled with integers 1 2 ldots n Also every vertex v has some integer priority p v associated with it All priorities are distinct It turns out that if you set a tree on fire it will burn to nothing However this process doesn t happen instantly At the beginning burns out the leaf a vertex is called to be a if it has only one adjacent vertex of the tree of the minimum priority Then burns out the leaf of the minimal priority of the remaining tree and so on This way the vertices turn into the leaves and burn out until only one vertex remains Then this vertex burns out as well Lena has prepared a tree of n vertices and every vertex in it has a priority p v v Lena is very curious about burning out this tree However she understands that if she will burn the tree now then it will disappear completely Lena is a kind girl and she will feel bad for the burned tree so she wants to study the process of burning the tree only in her mind Lena wants to process q queries each of them is one of three following types v assign the vertex v priority 1 max p 1 p 2 ldots p n v find the step at which the vertex v will burn out if the tree would be set on fire now v u find out which of the vertices v and u will burn out first if the tree would be set on fire now Notice that if all priorities would be distinct then after the query they will stay distinct as well Initially all priorities are distinct hence during any purely hypothetical of course burning of the tree all leafs would have distinct priorities ,data structures,math

In modern cryptography much is tied to the algorithmic complexity of solving several problems One of such problems is a discrete logarithm problem It is formulated as follows Let s fix a finite field and two it s elements a and b One need to fun such x that a x b or detect there is no such x It is most likely that modern mankind cannot solve the problem of discrete logarithm for a sufficiently large field size For example for a field of residues modulo prime number primes of 1024 or 2048 bits are considered to be safe However calculations with such large numbers can place a significant load on servers that perform cryptographic operations For this reason instead of a simple module residue field more complex fields are often used For such field no fast algorithms that use a field structure are known smaller fields can be used and operations can be properly optimized Developer Nikolai does not trust the generally accepted methods so he wants to invent his own Recently he read about a very strange field nimbers and thinks it s a great fit for the purpose The field of nimbers is defined on a set of integers from 0 to 2 2 k 1 for some positive integer k Bitwise exclusive or oplus operation is used as addition One of ways to define multiplication operation odot is following properties 0 odot a a odot 0 0 1 odot a a odot 1 a a odot b b odot a a odot b odot c a odot b odot c a odot b oplus c a odot b oplus a odot c If a 2 2 n for some integer n 0 and b a then a odot b a cdot b If a 2 2 n for some integer n 0 then a odot a frac 3 2 cdot a For example 4 odot 4 6 8 odot 8 4 odot 2 odot 4 odot 2 4 odot 4 odot 2 odot 2 6 odot 3 4 oplus 2 odot 3 4 odot 3 oplus 2 odot 2 oplus 1 4 odot 3 oplus 2 odot 2 oplus 2 odot 1 12 oplus 3 oplus 2 13 32 odot 64 16 odot 2 odot 16 odot 4 16 odot 16 odot 2 odot 4 24 odot 8 16 oplus 8 odot 8 16 odot 8 oplus 8 odot 8 128 oplus 13 141 5 odot 6 4 oplus 1 odot 4 oplus 2 4 odot 4 oplus 4 odot 2 oplus 4 odot 1 oplus 1 odot 2 6 oplus 8 oplus 4 oplus 2 8 Formally this algorithm can be described by following pseudo code multiply a b ans 0 for p1 in bits a numbers of bits of a equal to one for p2 in bits b numbers of bits of b equal to one ans ans xor multiply powers of 2 1 p1 1 p2 return ans multiply powers of 2 a b if a 1 or b 1 return a b n maximal value such 2 2 n max a b power 2 2 n if a power and b power return multiply power 3 2 multiply powers of 2 a power b power else if a power return multiply powers of 2 a power b power else return multiply powers of 2 a b power power It can be shown that this operations really forms a field Moreover than can make sense as game theory operations but that s not related to problem much With the help of appropriate caching and grouping of operations it is possible to calculate the product quickly enough which is important to improve speed of the cryptoalgorithm More formal definitions as well as additional properties can be clarified in the wikipedia article at link The authors of the task hope that the properties listed in the statement should be enough for the solution Powering for such muliplication is defined in same way formally a odot k underbrace a odot a odot cdots odot a k texttt times You need to analyze the proposed scheme strength For pairs of numbers a and b you need to find such x that a odot x b or determine that it doesn t exist ,math,data structures
