Each phone number consists of exactly digits.Also\r\nPasha has a number and two sequences of length ( is divisible by ) and .\r\nLet’s split the phone number into blocks of length . The first block\r\nwill be formed by digits from the phone number that are on positions ,\r\n,..., , the second block will be formed by digits from the phone number\r\nthat are on positions , , ..., and so on. Pasha considers a phone number\r\n, if the -th block doesn’t start from the digit and is divisible by if\r\nrepresented as an integer. To represent the block of length as an\r\ninteger, let’s write it out as a sequence , ,...,. Then the integer is\r\ncalculated as the result of the expression .Pasha asks you to calculate\r\nthe number of phone numbers of length , for the given , and . As this\r\nnumber can be too big, print it modulo .\r\n",

Let for this block the number must be divided on x and must not starts with digit y. Then the answer for this block  the number of numbers containing exactly k digits and which divisible by x, subtract the number of numbers which have the first digit equals to y and containing exactly k digits and plus the number of numbers which have the first digit equals to y?-?1 (only if y?>?0) and containing exactly k digits.",
