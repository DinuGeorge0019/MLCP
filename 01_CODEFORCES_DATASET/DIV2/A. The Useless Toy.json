    "statement": "Walking through the streets of Marshmallow City, Slastyona have spotted\r\nsome merchants selling a kind of useless toy which is very popular\r\nnowadays caramel spinner! Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately\r\nbought the strange contraption.Spinners in Sweetland have the form of\r\nV-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an\r\ninvisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4\r\npositions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the\r\nprevious, with the fourth one followed by the first one): After the\r\nspinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a\r\nfollowing algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second\r\nthen majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or\r\ncounter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun\r\nin.Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly seconds. Being\r\nfascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the\r\ndirection the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall\r\nthe starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the\r\ninformation she knows. Help her do this.\r\n",

    "editorial": "none.The sole fact that the spinner has four positions, which are\r\nrepeated periodically, leads us to the following observations that are\r\neasily verifiable: first thing is that no matter what the direction was,\r\nwhen is even weâre going to get the same ending position; secondly, if\r\nwe replace by , the resulting problem would have the same answer\r\n(basically we have removed full rotations of the spinner from\r\nconsideration). Thus, if , the answer is \"\". Otherwise, we have to find\r\nthe aforementioned remainder and find the direction of the spin, which\r\nis pretty straightforward. .\r\n",
