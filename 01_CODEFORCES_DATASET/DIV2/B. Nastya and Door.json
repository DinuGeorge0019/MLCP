Nastya and Door", "statement": "On February 14 Denis decided to give Valentine to Nastya and did not\r\ncome up with anything better than to draw a huge red heart on the door\r\nof the length k (k\r\nge 3). Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break\r\nthe door, throwing it on the mountains.Mountains are described by a\r\nsequence of heights a_1, a_2,\r\ndots, a_n in order from left to right (k\r\nle n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each\r\nother (that is, a_i\r\nne a_{i+1} for all i from 1 to n-1).Peaks of mountains on the segment\r\n[l,r] (from l to r) are called indexes i such that l < i < r, a_{i - 1}\r\n< a_i and a_i > a_{i + 1}. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes\r\nl and r for the segment . For example, if n=8 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6],\r\nthen the segment [1,8] has only two peaks (with indexes 3 and 6), and\r\nthere are no peaks on the segment [3, 6].To break the door, Nastya\r\nthrows it to a segment [l,l+k-1] of consecutive mountains of length k (1\r\nle l\r\nle n-k+1). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks\r\ninto two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in\r\ndifferent halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of\r\nthe mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door\r\nwill break into will be equal to p+1, where p is the number of peaks on\r\nthe segment [l,l+k-1].Nastya wants to break it into as many pieces as\r\npossible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that\r\nthe number of peaks on it is maximum. If there are several optimal\r\nsegments, Nastya wants to find one for which the value l is\r\nminimal.Formally, you need to choose a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1]\r\nthat has the maximum number of peaks. Among all such segments, you need\r\nto find the segment that has the minimum possible value l.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nint A[210000];\nint P[210000];\nint pre[210000];\n\nint main() {\n    int T; scanf(\"%d\", &T);\n    while (T--) {\n        int N, K;\n        scanf(\"%d%d\", &N, &K);\n        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)\n            scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n        for (int i = 1; i < N - 1; ++i)\n            P[i] = (A[i] > A[i - 1] && A[i] > A[i + 1]);\n        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) pre[i] = pre[i - 1] + P[i - 1];\n        int maxi = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i + K - 1 < N; ++i)\n            if (pre[maxi + K - 1] - pre[maxi + 1] < pre[i + K - 1] - pre[i + 1])\n                maxi = i;\n        printf(\"%d %d\\n\", pre[maxi + K - 1] - pre[maxi + 1] + 1, maxi + 1);\n    }\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1300", "interactive": false}
