They are numbered from to from left to right.This game will go on\r\nfor rounds. In each round, Ithea will give Chtholly an integer between\r\nand , and Chtholly needs to choose one of the sheets to write down this\r\nnumber (if there is already a number before, she will erase the original\r\none and replace it with the new one).Chtholly wins if, at any time, all\r\nthe sheets are filled with a number and the numbers are in\r\nnon-decreasing order looking from left to right from sheet to sheet ,\r\nand if after rounds she still doesn’t win, she loses the game.Chtholly\r\nreally wants to win the game as she wants to cook something for Willem.\r\nBut she doesn’t know how to win the game. So Chtholly finds you, and\r\nyour task is to write a program to receive numbers that Ithea gives\r\nChtholly and help her make the decision on which sheet of paper write\r\nthis number.\r\n",

    "editorial": "As the initial sheet \"has already\" in a non-decreasing order (although it has no numbers), what we should do is just \"maintain\" this order.\n\nWe use a simple method to do so: find the first sheet whose number is strictly greater than the given number (or it's an empty sheet) and replace it with the new number.\n\nFor each round, we either replace an existing number with a strictly smaller one, or fill in an empty sheet. The first case will happen at most c?-?1 times for each sheet, and the second case will happen only once for each sheet. Thus in total, we will modify a sheet for at most c times. Thus, the total rounds won't be more than n?×?c.\n\nTo pass all the tests, we only need to maintain 2 similar sequences, one non-decreasing from the first and one non-increasing from the last, which makes a total round of , precisely, and use binary search or brute force to complete the \"finding\" process.",
