    "editorial": "It turns out that it is actually easier to compute the complement of the problem  the maximum number of objects not destroyed. We can subtract this from the total number of objects to obtain our final answer.\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Let dp[x] be the maximum number of objects not destroyed in the range [0,?x] given that position x is unaffected by an explosion. We can compute dp[x] using the following recurrence:\n\n\nNow, if we can place an object to the right of all objects with any power level, we can destroy some suffix of the (sorted list of) objects. The answer is thus the maximum number of destroyed objects objects given that we destroy some suffix of the objects first. This can be easily evaluated as\n\n\nSince this is the complement of our answer, our final answer is actually\n\n\nTime Complexity  O(max(ai)), Memory Complexity  O(max(ai))",
