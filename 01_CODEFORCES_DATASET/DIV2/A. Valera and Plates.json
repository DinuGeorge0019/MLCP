At that, in order to eat a dish, he needs\r\nexactly one plate or bowl. We know that Valera can cook only two types\r\nof dishes. He can eat dishes of the first type from bowls and dishes of\r\nthe second type from either bowls or plates. When Valera finishes\r\neating, he leaves a dirty plate/bowl behind. His life philosophy doesn\u2019t\r\nlet him eat from dirty kitchenware. So sometimes he needs to wash his\r\nplate/bowl . Find the minimum number of times Valera will need to wash a\r\nplate/bowl, if he acts optimally.\r\n",
