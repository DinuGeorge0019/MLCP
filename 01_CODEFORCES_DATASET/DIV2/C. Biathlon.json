Biathlon", "statement": "Perhaps many have heard that the World Biathlon Championship has\r\nfinished. Although our hero Valera was not present at this spectacular\r\nevent himself and only watched it on TV, it excited him so much that he\r\ndecided to enroll in a biathlon section.Of course, biathlon as any\r\nsport, proved very difficult in practice. It takes much time and effort.\r\nWorkouts, workouts, and workouts, that\u2019s what awaited Valera on his way\r\nto great achievements in biathlon.As for the workouts, you all probably\r\nknow that every professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot\r\nprecisely at the shooting range. Only in this case you can hope to be\r\nsuccessful, because running and shooting are the two main components of\r\nbiathlon. Valera has been diligent in his ski trainings, which is why he\r\nruns really fast, however, his shooting accuracy is nothing to write\r\nhome about.On a biathlon base where Valera is preparing for the\r\ncompetition, there is a huge rifle range with targets. Each target have\r\nshape of a circle, and . At the last training session Valera made the\r\ntotal of shots. To make monitoring of his own results easier for him,\r\none rather well-known programmer (of course it is you) was commissioned\r\nto write a program that would reveal how many and which targets Valera\r\nhit. More specifically, for each target the program must print the\r\nnumber of successful shot (in the target), or \"-1\" if this was not hit.\r\nValera is counting on you and perhaps, thanks to you he will one day win\r\ninternational competitions.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <iomanip>\n#include <cstdlib>\nusing namespace std;\nstruct mishen\n{\n    int x, r, num, res;\n};\n\n\nint ABS(int x)\n{\n    if(x < 0) x = -x;\n    return x;\n}\n\n\nbool by_num(mishen x, mishen y)\n{\n    return(x.num < y.num);\n}\n\n\nbool by_x(mishen x, mishen y)\n{\n    return(x.x < y.x);\n}\n\n\nmishen a[10000];\nint n;\nint m, tx, ty, sum;\n\n\nint binary(int x)\n{\n    int l = 0, r = n - 1, m = 0;\n    while(l != r)\n    {\n        m = (l + r + 1) / 2;\n        if(a[m].x > x)  r = m - 1;\n        else            l = m;\n    }\n    return l;\n}\n\n\nint main()\n{\n    cin >> n;\n    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n    {\n        cin >> a[i].x >> a[i].r;\n        a[i].num = i;\n        a[i].res = -1;\n    }\n    sort(a, a + n, by_x);\n    cin >> m;\n    for(int i = 1; i <= m; i++)\n    {\n        cin >> tx >> ty;\n        int temp = binary(tx);\n        if(a[temp].res == -1  &&  (a[temp].x - tx) * (a[temp].x - tx) + ty * ty <= a[temp].r * a[temp].r)\n        {\n            sum++;\n            a[temp].res = i;\n        }\n        if(temp  &&  a[temp - 1].res == -1  &&  (a[temp - 1].x - tx) * (a[temp - 1].x - tx) + ty * ty <= a[temp - 1].r * a[temp - 1].r)\n        {\n            sum++;\n            a[temp - 1].res = i;\n        }\n        if(temp + 1 < n &&  a[temp + 1].res == -1  &&  (a[temp + 1].x - tx) * (a[temp + 1].x - tx) + ty * ty <= a[temp + 1].r * a[temp + 1].r)\n        {\n            sum++;\n            a[temp + 1].res = i;\n        }\n    }\n    sort(a, a + n, by_num);\n    cout << sum << endl;\n    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)  cout << a[i].res << ' ';\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["binary search", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1700", "interactive": false}
