All too long words should be replaced with a\r\nspecial abbreviation.This abbreviation is made like this: we write down\r\nthe first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the\r\nnumber of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is\r\nin decimal system and doesn’t contain any leading zeroes.Thus, \"\" will\r\nbe spelt as \"\", and \" will be spelt as \"\".You are suggested to\r\nautomatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that\r\nall too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words\r\nthat are not too long should not undergo any changes.\r\n",
