    "editorial": "Consider the abbreviations that are given to the first Olympiads. The first 10 Olympiads (from year 1989 to year 1998) receive one-digit abbreviations (IAO'9,?IAO'0,?...,?IAO'8). The next 100 Olympiads (1999?-?2098) obtain two-digit abbreviations, because all one-digit abbreviations are already taken, but the last two digits of 100 consecutive integers are pairwise different. Similarly, the next 1000 Olympiads get three-digit abbreviations and so on.\n\nNow examine the inversed problem (extract the year from an abbreviation). Let the abbreviation have k digits, then we know that all Olympiads with abbreviations of lengths (k?-?1),?(k?-?2),?...,?1 have passed before this one. The number of such Olympiads is 10k?-?1?+?10k?-?2?+?...?+?101?=?F and the current Olympiad was one of the 10k of the following. Therefore this Olympiad was held in years between (1989?+?F) and (1989?+?F?+?10k?-?1). As this segment consists of exactly 10k consecutive natural numbers, it contains a single number with a k-digit suffix that matches the current abbreviation. It is also the corresponding year."
