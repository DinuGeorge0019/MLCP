How many trees ", "statement": "In one very old text file there was written Great Wisdom. This Wisdom\r\nwas so Great that nobody could decipher it, even Phong the oldest among\r\nthe inhabitants of Mainframe. But still he managed to get some\r\ninformation from there. For example, he managed to learn that User\r\nlaunches games for pleasure and then terrible Game Cubes fall down on\r\nthe city, bringing death to those modules, who cannot win the game...For\r\nsure, as guard Bob appeared in Mainframe many modules stopped fearing\r\nGame Cubes. Because Bob (as he is alive yet) has never been defeated by\r\nUser, and he always meddles with Game Cubes, because he is programmed to\r\nthis.However, unpleasant situations can happen, when a Game Cube falls\r\ndown on Lost Angles. Because there lives a nasty virus Hexadecimal, who\r\nis... mmm... very strange. And she likes to play very much. So,\r\nwilly-nilly, Bob has to play with her first, and then with User.This\r\ntime Hexadecimal invented the following entertainment: Bob has to leap\r\nover binary search trees with nodes. We should remind you that a binary\r\nsearch tree is a binary tree, each node has a distinct key, for each\r\nnode the following is true: the left sub-tree of a node contains only\r\nnodes with keys less than the node\u2019s key, the right sub-tree of a node\r\ncontains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u2019s key. All the keys\r\nare different positive integer numbers from to . Each node of such a\r\ntree can have up to two children, or have no children at all (in the\r\ncase when a node is a leaf).In Hexadecimal\u2019s game all the trees are\r\ndifferent, but the height of each is not lower than . In this problem\r\nheight stands for the maximum amount of nodes on the way from the root\r\nto the remotest leaf, the root node and the leaf itself included. When\r\nBob leaps over a tree, it disappears. Bob gets the access to a Cube,\r\nwhen there are no trees left. He knows how many trees he will have to\r\nleap over in the worst case.
