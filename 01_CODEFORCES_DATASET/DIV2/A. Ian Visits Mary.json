Ian\r\nwould like to visit Mary by jumping around the Cartesian coordinate\r\nplane. Every second, he jumps from his current position (x_p, y_p) to\r\nanother lattice point (x_q, y_q), such that no lattice point other than\r\n(x_p, y_p) and (x_q, y_q) lies on the segment between point (x_p, y_p)\r\nand point (x_q, y_q). As Ian wants to meet Mary as soon as possible, he\r\nwants to jump towards point (a,b) using . Unfortunately, Ian is not good\r\nat maths. Can you help him?A lattice point is defined as a point with\r\nboth the x-coordinate and y-coordinate being integers.\r\n",

Indeed,\r\nconsider and where , since the value of the -coordinates of a point\r\nlying on the segment joining and , and is not at the endpoints, is\r\nstrictly between and , but there are no integers strictly between and ,\r\nthe point must not be a lattice point. Similarly, no lattice points lie\r\non the segment joining and with except for the endpoints. Therefore, Ian\r\ncan jump from to to .\r\n"
