    "editorial": "Problem: We have a circle with radius at position and we want to move it\r\nto with minimum moves possible. A move is to choose an arbitrary point\r\non the border of the circle and rotate the circle around it with\r\narbitrary angle. Hint: What is the shortest path between two points? A\r\ndirect line. So moving the center on that line with maximum move\r\npossible each time will guarantee minimal number of moves. Solution:\r\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s draw a straight line between the two centers. Clearly to move the\r\ncenter with maximum distance we need to rotate it around the\r\nintersection of the line and the circle with degrees. So the maximum\r\ndistance we can move the center each time is . Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continue moving the\r\ncenter with distance each time until the two circles intersects. Now\r\nobviously we can make the center moves into its final position by\r\nrotating it around one of the intersection points of the two circles\r\nuntil it reaches the final destination. Every time we make the circle\r\nmoves times except the last move it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be . Assume that the initial\r\ndistance between the two points is So the solution to the problem will\r\nbe . Time complexity: You have to be careful of precision errors. Here\r\nis a code that used only integer arithmetic operations 9529147.\r\n"
