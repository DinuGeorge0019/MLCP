    "statement": "It’s that time of the year when the Russians flood their countryside\r\nsummer cottages (dachas) and the bus stop has a lot of people. People\r\nrarely go to the dacha on their own, it’s usually a group, so the people\r\nstand in queue by groups.The bus stop queue has groups of people. The\r\n-th group from the beginning has people. Every minutes an empty bus\r\narrives at the bus stop, it can carry at most people. Naturally, the\r\npeople from the first group enter the bus first. Then go the people from\r\nthe second group and so on. Note that the order of groups in the queue\r\nnever changes. Moreover, if some group cannot fit all of its members\r\ninto the current bus, it waits for the next bus together with other\r\ngroups standing after it in the queue.Your task is to determine how many\r\nbuses is needed to transport all groups to the dacha countryside.\r\n",
