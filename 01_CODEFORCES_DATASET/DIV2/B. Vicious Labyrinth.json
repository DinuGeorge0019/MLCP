You want to help everyone get\r\nas close to the exit as possible by installing a teleporter in each cell\r\ni (1\r\nleq i\r\nleq n), which translocates the person in that cell to another cell\r\na_i.The labyrinth owner caught you in the act. Amused, she let you\r\ncontinue, but under some conditions: Everyone must use the teleporter\r\nexactly k times. No teleporter in any cell can lead to the same cell it\r\nis in. Formally, i\r\nneq a_i for all 1\r\nleq i\r\nleq n.You must find a teleporter configuration that minimizes the sum of\r\ndistances of all individuals from the exit after using the teleporter\r\nexactly k times while still satisfying the restrictions of the labyrinth\r\nowner.If there are many possible configurations, you can output any of\r\nthem.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "graphs", "greedy", "implementation", "math"], "dificulty": "1100", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV2\\B.
