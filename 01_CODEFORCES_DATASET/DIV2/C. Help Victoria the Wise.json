The present is a surprise\r\nbox, yet Vasilisa the Wise doesn\u2019t know yet what the surprise actually\r\nis because she cannot open the box. She hopes that you can help her in\r\nthat.The box\u2019s lock is constructed like that. The box itself is\r\nrepresented by an absolutely perfect black cube with the identical\r\ndeepening on each face (those are some foreign nanotechnologies that the\r\nfar away kingdom scientists haven\u2019t dreamt of). The box is accompanied\r\nby six gems whose form matches the deepenings in the box\u2019s faces. The\r\nbox can only be opened after it is correctly decorated by the gems, that\r\nis, when each deepening contains exactly one gem. Two ways of decorating\r\nthe box are considered the same if they can be obtained one from the\r\nother one by arbitrarily rotating the box (note that the box is\r\nrepresented by a perfect nanotechnological cube)Now Vasilisa the Wise\r\nwants to know by the given set of colors the following: in how many ways\r\nwould she decorate the box in the worst case to open it? To answer this\r\nquestion it is useful to know that two gems of one color are\r\nindistinguishable from each other. Help Vasilisa to solve this\r\nchallenging problem.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cctype>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <string>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <map>\n#include <set>\n#include <queue>\n#include <stack>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <numeric>\n#include <bitset>\n#include <list>\n#include <stdexcept>\n#include <functional>\n#include <utility>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int turn[3][4] = {\n    {0, 1, 2, 3},\n    {0, 4, 2, 5},\n    {3, 4, 1, 5}\n};\nint tot;\nbool flag;\nchar c[10], C[10000][10], tmp[10];\nvoid dfs(int a)\n{\n    if (flag) return;\n    if (a == 3) {\n        for (int i = 1; i <= tot; i++) {\n            bool don = 1;\n            for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++)\n                if (tmp[j] != C[i][j]) {\n                    don = 0;\n                    break;\n                }\n            if (don) {\n                flag = 1;\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n        return;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++) {\n        dfs(a + 1);\n        char A = tmp[turn[a][0]];\n        tmp[turn[a][0]] = tmp[turn[a][1]];\n        tmp[turn[a][1]] = tmp[turn[a][2]];\n        tmp[turn[a][2]] = tmp[turn[a][3]];\n        tmp[turn[a][3]] = A;\n    }\n}\nint main()\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c[i]);\n    sort(c, c + 6);\n    tot = 0;\n    do {\n        flag = 0;\n        memcpy(tmp, c, sizeof(c));\n        dfs(0);\n        if (!flag) {\n            tot++;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)\n                C[tot][i] = c[i];\n        }\n    } while (next_permutation(c, c + 6));\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", tot);\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force"], "dificulty": "1700", "interactive": false}
