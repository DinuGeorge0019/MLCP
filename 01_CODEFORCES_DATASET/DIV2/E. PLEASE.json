PLEASE", "statement": "As we all know Barney\u2019s job is \"PLEASE\" and he has not much to do at\r\nwork. That\u2019s why he started playing \"cups and key\". In this game there\r\nare three identical cups arranged in a line from left to right.\r\nInitially key to Barney\u2019s heart is under the middle cup. Then at one\r\nturn Barney swaps the cup in the middle with any of other two cups\r\nrandomly (he choses each with equal probability), so the chosen cup\r\nbecomes the middle one. Game lasts turns and Barney a cup to swap with\r\nthe middle one within each turn, and the key always remains in the cup\r\nit was at the start.After -th turn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup\r\ncontains the key. The girl points to the middle one but Barney was\r\ndistracted while making turns and doesn\u2019t know if the key is under the\r\nmiddle cup. That\u2019s why he asked you to tell him the probability that\r\ngirl guessed right.Number of game turns can be extremely large, that\u2019s\r\nwhy Barney did not give it to you. Instead he gave you an array such\r\nthat in other words, is multiplication of all elements of the given\r\narray.Because of precision difficulties, Barney asked you to tell him\r\nthe answer as an irreducible fraction. In other words you need to find\r\nit as a fraction such that , where is the greatest common divisor. Since\r\nand can be extremely large, you only need to find the remainders of\r\ndividing each of them by .Please note that we want of and to be , after\r\ndividing by .\r\n", "solutions": ["//wait darn\n\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint N = 1000000007;\n\nlong long powmod(long long a, long long b)\n{\n    if(b == 0)\n        return 1;\n\n    if(b == 1)\n        return a;\n\n    long long i = powmod(a,b/2);\n    i*=i;\n    i%=N;\n    if(b%2 == 0)\n        return i;\n    else\n        return((i*a)%N);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    long long a=2;\n    long long b;\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    long long p=1;\n    for(int i = 0; i < n;i++)\n    {\n        cin >> b;\n        a = powmod(a,b);\n        p*=(b%2);\n    }\n    a*= (N+1)/2;\n    a%= N;\n    b = a;\n    if(p%2 == 0)\n        b += 1;\n    else\n        b+= (N-1);\n    b %= N;\n    b *= (N+1)/3;\n    b %= N;\n\n    cout << b << \"/\" << a;\n}\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "math", "number theory"], "dificulty": "2000", "interactive": false}
