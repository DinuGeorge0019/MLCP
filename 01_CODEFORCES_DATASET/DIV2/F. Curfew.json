Curfew", "statement": "Instructors of Some Informatics School make students go to bed.The house\r\ncontains rooms, in each room exactly students were supposed to sleep.\r\nHowever, at the time of curfew it happened that many students are not\r\nlocated in their assigned rooms. The rooms are arranged in a row and\r\nnumbered from to . Initially, in -th room there are students. All\r\nstudents are currently somewhere in the house, therefore . Also\r\ninstructors live in this house.The process of curfew enforcement is the\r\nfollowing. One instructor starts near room and moves toward room , while\r\nthe second instructor starts near room and moves toward room . After\r\nprocessing current room, each instructor moves on to the next one. Both\r\ninstructors enter rooms and move simultaneously, if is odd, then only\r\nthe first instructor processes the middle room. When all rooms are\r\nprocessed, the process ends.When an instructor processes a room, she\r\ncounts the number of students in the room, then turns off the light, and\r\nlocks the room. Also, if the number of students inside the processed\r\nroom is not equal to , the instructor writes down the number of this\r\nroom into her notebook (and turns off the light, and locks the room).\r\nInstructors are in a hurry (to prepare the study plan for the next day),\r\nso they don\u2019t care about who is in the room, but only about the number\r\nof students.While instructors are inside the rooms, students can run\r\nbetween rooms that are not locked and not being processed. A student can\r\nrun by at most rooms, that is she can move to a room with number that\r\ndiffers my at most . Also, after (or instead of) running each student\r\ncan hide under a bed in a room she is in. In this case the instructor\r\nwill not count her during the processing. In each room any number of\r\nstudents can hide simultaneously.Formally, here is what\u2019s happening: A\r\ncurfew is announced, at this point in room there are students. Each\r\nstudent can run to another room but not further than rooms away from her\r\ninitial room, or stay in place. After that each student can optionally\r\nhide under a bed. Instructors enter room and room , they count students\r\nthere and lock the room (after it no one can enter or leave this room).\r\nEach student from rooms with numbers from to can run to another room but\r\nnot further than rooms away from her room, or stay in place. Each\r\nstudent can optionally hide under a bed. Instructors move from room to\r\nroom and from room to room . This process continues until all rooms are\r\nprocessed. Let denote the number of rooms in which the first instructor\r\ncounted the number of non-hidden students different from , and be the\r\nsame number for the second instructor. Students know that the principal\r\nwill only listen to one complaint, therefore they want to minimize the\r\nmaximum of numbers . Help them find this value if they use the optimal\r\nstrategy.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int N=100100;\nint a[N],n,d,b;\nint gsm(long long l,long long r){\n\tif(l<1)l=1;if(r>n)r=n;\n\treturn a[r]-a[l-1];\n}\nint main(){\n\tscanf(\"%d%d%d\",&n,&d,&b);\n\tfor(int i=1;i<=n;i++)scanf(\"%d\",a+i);\n\tfor(int i=1;i<=n;i++)a[i]+=a[i-1];\n\tint Lu=0,Ru=0,fcnt1=0,fcnt2=0;\n\tfor(int i=1;i<=n/2;i++){\n\t\tint u=gsm(1,i+(long long)i*d);\n\t\tif(u>=Lu+b){\n\t\t\tLu+=b;\n\t\t}else fcnt1++;\n\t\tu=gsm(n-i+1-(long long)i*d,n);\n\t\tif(u>=Ru+b){\n\t\t\tRu+=b;\n\t\t}else fcnt2++;\n\t}\n\tprintf(\"%d\\n\",max(fcnt1,fcnt2));\n}\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy"], "dificulty": "2300", "interactive": false}
