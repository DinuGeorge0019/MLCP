Students which didn\u2019t pass the exam didn\u2019t\r\ncelebrate in any of those restaurants and elected to stay home to\r\nprepare for their reexamination. However, this quickly bored Vasya and\r\nhe started checking celebration photos on the Kilogramm. He found out\r\nthat, in total, BugDonalds was visited by A students, BeaverKing by B\r\nstudents and C students visited both restaurants. Vasya also knows that\r\nthere are N students in his group.Based on this info, Vasya wants to\r\ndetermine either if his data contradicts itself or, if it doesn\u2019t, how\r\nmany students in his group didn\u2019t pass the exam. Can you help him so he\r\nwon\u2019t waste his valuable preparation time?\r\n", "solutions": ["// who's it from?\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long ll;\ntypedef pair<int, int> pii;\n#define f first\n#define s second\n#define SZ(x) (int)(x).size()\n#define ALL(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()\n\nint32_t main() {\n\tios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n\tcin.tie(0);\n\tint A, B, C, N;\n\tcin >> A >> B >> C >> N;\n\tint x = A + B - C;\n\tif (N - x > 0 && C <= A && C <= B) {\n\t\tcout << N - x << endl;\n\t} else {\n\t\tcout << -1 << endl;\n\t}\n\treturn 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "1000", "interactive": false}
