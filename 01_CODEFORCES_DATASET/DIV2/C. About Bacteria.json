The job isn\u2019t\r\ndifficult, but the salary is high.At the beginning of the first\r\nexperiment there is a single bacterium in the test tube. Every second\r\neach bacterium in the test tube divides itself into bacteria. After that\r\nsome abnormal effects create more bacteria in the test tube. Thus, if at\r\nthe beginning of some second the test tube had bacteria, then at the end\r\nof the second it will have bacteria.The experiment showed that after\r\nseconds there were exactly bacteria and the experiment ended at this\r\npoint.For the second experiment Qwerty is going to sterilize the test\r\ntube and put there bacteria. He hasn\u2019t started the experiment yet but he\r\nalready wonders, how many seconds he will need to grow at least\r\nbacteria. The ranger thinks that the bacteria will divide by the same\r\nrule as in the first experiment. Help Qwerty and find the minimum number\r\nof seconds needed to get a tube with at least bacteria in the second\r\nexperiment.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main(void){\n    long long k, b, n, t;\n    cin >> k >> b >> n >> t;\n    long long curr = 1, time = 0;\n    while (curr < t) {\n        curr = k * curr + b;\n        ++time;\n    }\n    if (curr > t) --time;\n    if (time > n) time = n;\n    cout << n - time<< endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math"], "dificulty": "1700", "interactive": false}
