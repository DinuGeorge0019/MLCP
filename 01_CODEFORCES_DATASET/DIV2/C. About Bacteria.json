    "statement": "Qwerty the Ranger took up a government job and arrived on planet Mars.\r\nHe should stay in the secret lab and conduct some experiments on\r\nbacteria that have funny and abnormal properties. The job isn’t\r\ndifficult, but the salary is high.At the beginning of the first\r\nexperiment there is a single bacterium in the test tube. Every second\r\neach bacterium in the test tube divides itself into bacteria. After that\r\nsome abnormal effects create more bacteria in the test tube. Thus, if at\r\nthe beginning of some second the test tube had bacteria, then at the end\r\nof the second it will have bacteria.The experiment showed that after\r\nseconds there were exactly bacteria and the experiment ended at this\r\npoint.For the second experiment Qwerty is going to sterilize the test\r\ntube and put there bacteria. He hasn’t started the experiment yet but he\r\nalready wonders, how many seconds he will need to grow at least\r\nbacteria. The ranger thinks that the bacteria will divide by the same\r\nrule as in the first experiment. Help Qwerty and find the minimum number\r\nof seconds needed to get a tube with at least bacteria in the second\r\nexperiment.\r\n",

    "editorial": "The first solution. Consider sequence a0?=?1, ai?=?ai?-?1k?+?b:\na0, a1, a2, ..., an?=?z.\nYou can see that for all numbers from segment [a0,?a1?-?1] you can number not less than z using exactly n steps. But for n?-?1 steps you will bet number less than z. It works because transformation is monotonous. Analogically, for numbers from segments [a1,?a2?-?1], [a2,?a3?-?1], etc, you need exactly n?-?1, n?-?2, etc steps. So you just need find segment that contains number t. You can do it by generate a few first members of the sequence a. You need no more than t members.\n\nThe second solution. Equation:\ntkx?+?b(kx?-?1?+?kx?-?2...?+?1)???kn?+?b(kx?-?1?+?kx?-?2...?+?1)\nUsing formula for geometric progression you can get:\n\nFor k???1 we can multiply both sides by k?-?1, (you can consider case k?=?1 by yourself).\nt(k?-?1)kx?+?bkx?-?b???(k?-?1)kn?+?bkn?-?b\n\nkx(t(k?-?1)?+?b)???kn(k?-?1?+?b)\n\n\n\nSo, you can find value n?-?x using simply raising to a power.",
