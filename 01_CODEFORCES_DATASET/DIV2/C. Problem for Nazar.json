Problem for Nazar", "statement": "Nazar, a student of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, is\r\nknown for his outstanding mathematical abilities. Today a math teacher\r\ngave him a .Consider two infinite sets of numbers. The first set\r\nconsists of odd positive numbers (1, 3, 5, 7,\r\nldots), and the second set consists of even positive numbers (2, 4, 6,\r\n8,\r\nldots). At the first stage, the teacher writes the first number on the\r\nendless blackboard from the first set, in the second stage the first two\r\nnumbers from the second set, on the third stage the next four numbers\r\nfrom the first set, on the fourth the next eight numbers from the second\r\nset and so on. In other words, at each stage, starting from the second,\r\nhe writes out numbers than at the previous one, and also from which\r\nthese numbers are written out . The ten first written numbers: 1, 2, 4,\r\n3, 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10. Let\u2019s number the numbers written, starting .The\r\ntask is to find the sum of numbers with numbers from l to r for given\r\nintegers l and r. The answer may be big, so you need to find the\r\nremainder of the division by 1000000007 (10^9+7).Nazar thought about\r\nthis problem for a long time, but didn\u2019t come up with a solution.
