    "statement": "Once when Gerald studied in the first year at school, his teacher gave\r\nthe class the following homework. She offered the students a string\r\nconsisting of small Latin letters; the task was to learn the way the\r\nletters that the string contains are written. However, as Gerald is too\r\nlazy, he has no desire whatsoever to learn those letters. Thatâ€™s why he\r\ndecided to lose some part of the string (not necessarily a connected\r\npart). The lost part can consist of any number of segments of any\r\nlength, at any distance from each other. However, Gerald knows that if\r\nhe loses more than characters, it will be very suspicious. Find the\r\nleast number of distinct characters that can remain in the string after\r\nno more than characters are deleted. You also have to find any possible\r\nway to delete the characters.\r\n",

    "editorial": "Lets count up the number of entries to string of every letter. Let Gerald choose x letter and lose them. Obvious thet if he lose x rarest letters then overall number of losed letter do not increase, and then if he can lose some x lettes, he can lose x rarest ones. Thus it's easy to determine if Gerald can loses x letters. And now to calculate the answer one only need to find the minimal such x, so Gerald can lose x letters.",
