His character has the following\r\nability: given an enemy hero, deal a instant damage to him, and then\r\nheal that enemy b health points at the end of every second, for exactly\r\nc seconds, starting one second after the ability is used. That means\r\nthat if the ability is used at time t, the enemy\u2019s health decreases by a\r\nat time t, and then increases by b at time points t + 1, t + 2, ..., t +\r\nc due to this ability.The ability has a cooldown of d seconds, i. e. if\r\nMeka-Naruto uses it at time moment t, next time he can use it is the\r\ntime t + d. Please note that he can only use the ability at integer\r\npoints in time, so all changes to the enemy\u2019s health also occur at\r\ninteger times only.The effects from different uses of the ability may\r\nstack with each other; that is, the enemy which is currently under k\r\nspells gets k\r\ncdot b amount of heal this time. Also, if several health changes occur\r\nat the same moment, they are all counted at once.Now Meka-Naruto wonders\r\nif he can kill the enemy by just using the ability each time he can\r\n(that is, every d seconds). The enemy is killed if their health points\r\nbecome 0 or less. Assume that the enemy\u2019s health is not affected in any\r\nway other than by Meka-Naruto\u2019s character ability.
