    "statement": "Young Timofey has a birthday today! He got kit of cubes as a birthday\r\npresent from his parents. Every cube has a number , which is written on\r\nit. Timofey put all the cubes in a row and went to unpack other\r\npresents.In this time, Timofey’s elder brother, Dima reordered the cubes\r\nusing the following rule. Suppose the cubes are numbered from to in\r\ntheir order. Dima performs several steps, on step he reverses the\r\nsegment of cubes from -th to -th. He does this while .After performing\r\nthe operations Dima went away, being very proud of himself. When Timofey\r\nreturned to his cubes, he understood that their order was changed. Help\r\nTimofey as fast as you can and save the holiday restore the initial\r\norder of the cubes using information of their current location.\r\n",

    "editorial": "operations are reversible. If we apply them to the\ncurrent order, we will get the initial. Also note that all the elements\non even positions will remain on their places. Such numbers are affected\nan even number of times, so nothing will change. Similarly all elements\non odd positions will change places with simmetrial ones relatively the\ncentre. So, we change elements on odd places with their pairs. This\nworks for time.Authorâs solution: http://pastebin.com/X8R0i9vM\n",
