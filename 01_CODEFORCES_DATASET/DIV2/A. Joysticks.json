In one minute joystick either\r\ndischarges by 2 percent (if not connected to a charger) or charges by 1\r\npercent (if connected to a charger).Game continues while both joysticks\r\nhave a positive charge. Hence, if at the beginning of minute some\r\njoystick is charged by 1 percent, it has to be connected to a charger,\r\notherwise the game stops. If some joystick completely discharges (its\r\ncharge turns to 0), the game also stops.Determine the maximum number of\r\nminutes that game can last. It is prohibited to pause the game, i. e. at\r\neach moment both joysticks should be enabled.
