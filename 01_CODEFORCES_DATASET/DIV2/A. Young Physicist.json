    "statement": "A guy named Vasya attends the final grade of a high school. One day\r\nVasya decided to watch a match of his favorite hockey team. And, as the\r\nboy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the\r\nhomework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next\r\nday the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a\r\nlesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an\r\nidle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be\r\nconsidered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had\r\nonly to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" thought\r\nVasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0.\r\nSo, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there\r\ncan be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without\r\nyour help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is\r\nidle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.\r\n",
