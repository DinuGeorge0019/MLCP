    "editorial": "You were given a bracket sequence s consisting of brackets of two kinds. You were to find regular bracket sequence that was a substring of s and contains as many <<>> braces as possible.\n\nWe will try to determine corresponding closing bracket for every opening one. Formally, let a bracket on the i-th position be opening, then the closing bracket on the position j is corresponding to it if and only if a substring si... sj is the shortest regular bracket sequence that begins from the i-th position. In common case there can be brackets with no corresponding ones.\n\nWe scan the sting s and put positions with the opening brackets into a stack. Let us proceed the i-th position. If si is an opening bracket we simply put i on the top of the stack. Otherwise, we have to clean the stack if the stack is empty or the bracket on the top does not correspond to the current one. But if the bracket on the top is ok we just remove the top of the stack and remember that the bracket on position i is corresponding to the bracket removed from the top. So, we find all the correspondings for all the brackets.\n\nThen we can split s into blocks. Let block be a segment [l,?r] such that the bracket on the r-th position is corresponding for the bracket on the i-th and there is no couple of corresponding brackets on positions x and y such that  and [l,?r]???[x,?y]. It is easy to understand that the blocks do not intersect and the split is unique. We can join the consequent blocks into the regular bracket sequences. We should join as many blocks as possible in order to get the maximal number of braces. We get several substrings that are regular bracket sequences after we join all the consecutive blocks. The answer is the substring that has the largest amount of braces <<>>. The complexity is O(|s|)."
