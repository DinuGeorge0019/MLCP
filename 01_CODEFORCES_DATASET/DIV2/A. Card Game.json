The\r\nproblem does not state all the gameâ€™s rules explicitly you can find them\r\nlater yourselves if you want.To play durak you need a pack of cards.\r\nEach card has a suit (\"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\") and a rank (in the increasing\r\norder \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\"). At the beginning of the\r\ngame one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump. The players move like\r\nthat: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the\r\nother one should beat each of them with his cards.A card beats another\r\none if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher\r\nrank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump\r\ncard whatever the cards ranks are. In all other cases you can not beat\r\nthe second card with the first one.You are given the trump suit and two\r\ndifferent cards. Determine whether the first one beats the second one or\r\nnot.\r\n",

    "editorial": " Solution of this problem is written in the fourth paragraph of the statements. You should carefully read and implement it. Only one difficult part is how to to determine which card has higher rank. You can for every card iterate over array [ '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A' ] and determine numbers of ranks in this array. Finally, just compare them.",
