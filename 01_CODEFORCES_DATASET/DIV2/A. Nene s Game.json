    "name": "A. Nene s Game",
    "statement": "Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers\r\na_1, a_2,\r\nldots, a_k.In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In\r\neach of the rounds of this game, the following happens: Nene finds the\r\na_1-th, a_2-th,\r\nldots, a_k-th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game\r\nsimultaneously. If the i-th player in a row should be kicked out, but\r\nthere are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. Once no one\r\nis kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are still\r\nin the game are declared as winners.For example, consider the game with\r\na=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players be named player , player ,\r\nldots, player in the order they are lined up initially. Then, Before the\r\nfirst round, players are lined up as . Nene finds the 3-rd and the 5-th\r\nplayers in a row. These are players and . They are kicked out in the\r\nfirst round. Now players are lined up as . Nene finds the 3-rd and the\r\n5-th players in a row. The 3-rd player is player and there is no 5-th\r\nplayer in a row. Thus, only player is kicked out in the second round. In\r\nthe third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends\r\nafter this round. Players and are declared as the winners. Nene has not\r\nyet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene gave you\r\nq integers n_1, n_2,\r\nldots, n_q and you should answer the following question for each 1\r\nle i\r\nle q : How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i\r\nplayers in the game initially?\r\n",
