    "statement": "Small, but very brave, mouse Brain was not accepted to summer school of\r\nyoung villains. He was upset and decided to postpone his plans of taking\r\nover the world, but to become a photographer instead.As you may know,\r\nthe coolest photos are on the film (because you can specify the hashtag\r\nfilm for such).Brain took a lot of colourful pictures on colored and\r\nblack-and-white film. Then he developed and translated it into a digital\r\nform. But now, color and black-and-white photos are in one folder, and\r\nto sort them, one needs to spend more than one hour!As soon as Brain is\r\na photographer not programmer now, he asks you to help him determine for\r\na photo whether it is colored or black-and-white.Photo can be\r\nrepresented as a matrix sized , and each element of the matrix stores a\r\nsymbol indicating corresponding pixel color. There are only colors: \u2019C\u2019\r\n(cyan) \u2019M\u2019 (magenta) \u2019Y\u2019 (yellow) \u2019W\u2019 (white) \u2019G\u2019 (grey) \u2019B\u2019 (black) The\r\nphoto is considered black-and-white if it has only white, black and grey\r\npixels in it. If there are any of cyan, magenta or yellow pixels in the\r\nphoto then it is considered colored.\r\n",
