Ilya and Bank Account", "statement": "Ilya is a very clever lion, he lives in an unusual city ZooVille. In\r\nthis city all the animals have their rights and obligations. Moreover,\r\nthey even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is\r\nan integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This\r\nmeans that the owner of the account owes the bank money.Ilya the Lion\r\nhas recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the\r\ngift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last\r\ndigit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no\r\nmore than once. For example, if the state of Ilya\u2019s bank account is\r\n-123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance\r\nequal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the\r\naccount balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use\r\nthe opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.Ilya is not very good\r\nat math, and that\u2019s why he asks you to help him maximize his bank\r\naccount. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained\r\nusing the bank\u2019s gift.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cmath>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <cstring>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\tint n, a, b, c;\n\tbool flag;\n\tscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\tif (n > 0) flag = 0; else flag = 1;\n\tn = abs(n);\n\ta = n;\n\tb = n / 10;\n\tc = b / 10 * 10 + n % 10;\n\tif (flag)\n\t\ta = -a, b = -b, c = -c;\n\tprintf(\"%d\\n\", max(a, max(b, c)));\n\tfclose(stdin);\n\tfclose(stdout);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation", "number theory"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
