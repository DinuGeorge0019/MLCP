However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some\r\ncandies for himself.This means the process of eating candies is the\r\nfollowing: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer k, same for\r\nall days. After that, in the morning he eats k candies from the box (if\r\nthere are less than k candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the\r\nevening Petya eats 10\r\n",

    "editorial": "EditorialIt is easy to check that if for some value the necessary\r\ncondition is met (Vasya eats at least half of the candies), then it is\r\nmet for each integer greater . ProofLetâs consider the number of candies\r\nremaining at the evening of each day for some selected let candies\r\nremain at day . If Vasya will use another number > we will have less\r\ncandies in the first day: < . So Petya will eat no more candies than in\r\nthe first case (for ), but in the next day the number of candies will be\r\nnot greater than in the first case (if > then ). The same way, including\r\nthat > at the evening of the second day we get < and so on. In general,\r\nfor each we have < , so Petya will eat not more candies than in the\r\nfirst case in total. It means that Vasya will eat not less candies than\r\nin the first case.So this problem can be solved using the binary search\r\n(answer) approach. In order to check whether selected is applicable it\r\nnecessary just to implement the process described in the problem\r\nstatement. Since Petya eats of candies, its amount decreases\r\nexponentially, so there will be only few days before all the candies\r\nwill be eaten. In the worst case it is necessary 378 days. Formally the\r\ncomplexity of the solution is .Like in the previous problem it is\r\nrecommended to avoid floating operations and to use only integer types.\r\n",
