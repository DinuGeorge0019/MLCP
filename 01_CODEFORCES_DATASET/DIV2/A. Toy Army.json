Toy Army", "statement": "The hero of our story, Valera, and his best friend Arcady are still in\r\nschool, and therefore they spend all the free time playing turn-based\r\nstrategy \"GAGA: Go And Go Again\". The gameplay is as follows. There are\r\ntwo armies on the playing field each of which consists of men ( is\r\nalways even). The current player specifies for each of her soldiers an\r\nenemy\u2019s soldier he will shoot (a target) and then all the player\u2019s\r\nsoldiers shot simultaneously. This is a game world, and so each soldier\r\nshoots perfectly, that is he absolutely always hits the specified\r\ntarget. If an enemy soldier is hit, he will surely die. It may happen\r\nthat several soldiers had been indicated the same target. Killed\r\nsoldiers do not participate in the game anymore. The game \"GAGA\"\r\nconsists of three steps: first Valera makes a move, then Arcady, then\r\nValera again and the game ends. You are asked to calculate the maximum\r\ntotal number of soldiers that may be killed during the game.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <iomanip>\n#include <cstdlib>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint n, res;\nint main()\n{\n    cin >> n;\n    cout << 3 * (n / 2);\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math", "number theory"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
