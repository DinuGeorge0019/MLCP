Now the first mug has milliliters of the drink, the\r\nsecond one has milliliters and so on. The bottle has milliliters left\r\nand Polycarpus plans to pour them into the mugs so that the main\r\nequation was fulfilled.Write a program that would determine what volume\r\nof the drink Polycarpus needs to add into each mug to ensure that the\r\nfollowing two conditions were fulfilled simultaneously: there were\r\nmilliliters poured in total. That is, the bottle need to be emptied;\r\nafter the process is over, the volumes of the drink in the mugs should\r\nbe equal.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<iostream>\n#include<cstdio>\n#include <string>\n#include<set>\n#include<algorithm>\n#include<vector>\n#include<map>\nusing namespace std;\n\ndouble a[100];\n\nint main()\n{\n    #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE\n        freopen(\"input.txt\", \"rt\", stdin);\n        freopen(\"output.txt\", \"wt\", stdout);\n    #endif\n\n    int n;\n    double b, sum, m = 0, one;\n    cin >> n >> b;\n    sum = b;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n    {\n        cin >> a[i];\n        sum += a[i];\n        m = max(m, a[i]);\n    }\n\n    one = sum / n;\n    if (m > one)\n    {\n        cout << -1;\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n        printf(\"%0.9lf\\n\",  - a[i] + one);\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math"], "dificulty": "1100", "interactive": false}
