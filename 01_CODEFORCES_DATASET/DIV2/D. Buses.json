Buses", "statement": "Little boy Gerald studies at school which is quite far from his house.\r\nThat\u2019s why he has to go there by bus every day. The way from home to\r\nschool is represented by a segment of a straight line; the segment\r\ncontains exactly bus stops. All of them are numbered with integers from\r\nto in the order in which they follow from Gerald\u2019s home. The bus stop by\r\nGerald\u2019s home has number and the bus stop by the school has number\r\n.There are buses running between the house and the school: the -th bus\r\ngoes from stop to (), visiting all the intermediate stops in the order\r\nin which they follow on the segment. Besides, Gerald\u2019s no idiot and he\r\nwouldn\u2019t get off the bus until it is still possible to ride on it closer\r\nto the school (obviously, getting off would be completely pointless). In\r\nother words, Gerald can get on the -th bus on any stop numbered from to\r\ninclusive, but he can get off the -th bus only on the bus stop .Gerald\r\ncan\u2019t walk between the bus stops and he also can\u2019t move in the direction\r\nfrom the school to the house.Gerald wants to know how many ways he has\r\nto get from home to school. Tell him this number. Two ways are\r\nconsidered different if Gerald crosses some segment between the stops on\r\ndifferent buses. As the number of ways can be too much, find the\r\nremainder of a division of this number by ().\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nstruct pr{int num, v, fl;} pp[200005], pp2[200005];\nint s[100005], f[100005], n, m, top;\nlong long num_f[200005], v[200005];\n\nint cmp(const void *c1, const void *c2)\n{return ((pr*)c1)->v-((pr*)c2)->v;}\n\nint max(int a, int b) {return a>b? a: b;}\n\nint main()\n{\n    int i, j, a, b, f1;\n    long long d=1000000007, tmp;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    for(i=0; i<m; i++)\n    {\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n        pp[2*i].v=a; pp[2*i+1].v=b;\n        pp[2*i].fl=0; pp[2*i+1].fl=1; \n        pp[2*i].num=pp[2*i+1].num=i;\n    }\n    qsort(pp, 2*m, sizeof(pr), cmp);\n    if (pp[0].v>0) {printf(\"0\"); return 0;}\n    if (pp[2*m-1].v<n) {printf(\"0\"); return 0;}\n    for(i=0; i<2*m; i++) pp2[i]=pp[i];\n    for(i=1; i<2*m; i++)\n        if (pp[i].v==pp[i-1].v) pp2[i].v=pp2[i-1].v;\n        else pp2[i].v=pp2[i-1].v+1;\n    top=pp2[2*m-1].v+1;\n    for(i=0; i<2*m; i++)\n        if (pp2[i].fl) f[pp2[i].num]=pp2[i].v;\n        else s[pp2[i].num]=pp2[i].v;\n    for(i=0; i<m; i++)\n        num_f[f[i]]++;\n    j=1; v[0]=1;\n    for(i=0; i<2*m; i++)\n        if (pp2[i].fl) \n        {\n            for(; j<pp2[i].v; j++) v[j]=(v[j]+v[j-1])%d;\n            if (s[pp2[i].num]-1<0) tmp=0;\n            else tmp=v[s[pp2[i].num]-1];\n            v[pp2[i].v]=(d+v[pp2[i].v]+v[pp2[i].v-1]-tmp)%d;\n        }\n    printf(\"%lld\", v[top-1]);\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["binary search", "data structures", "dp"], "dificulty": "1700", "interactive": false}
