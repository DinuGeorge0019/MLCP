War of the Corporations", "statement": "A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away two giant IT-corporations\r\nPineapple and Gogol continue their fierce competition. Crucial moment is\r\njust around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it\u2019s new tablet Lastus\r\n3000.This new device is equipped with specially designed artificial\r\nintelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the\r\nrelease of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out,\r\nthat the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name\r\nof the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on\r\nits name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol\u2019s\r\nartificial intelligence.Pineapple insists, that the name of their phone\r\noccurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology\r\nwas already printed on all devices, the Gogol\u2019s director decided to\r\nreplace some characters in AI name with \"\". As this operation is pretty\r\nexpensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace\r\nwith \"\", such that the name of AI doesn\u2019t contain the name of the phone\r\nas a substring.Substring is a continuous subsequence of a string.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int mod = 1000000007;\nconst int inf = 1001001001;\n\nint n,k,ans;\nstring S,s;\nint main()\n{\n    //freopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n    //freopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);\n\n    cin >> S >> s;\n    int k=0;\n    for (int i=0; i<S.size(); i++){\n        k=0;\n        for (int j=0; j<s.size(); j++){\n            if (S[i+j]==s[j]) k++;\n        }\n        if (k==s.size()){\n            S[i+s.size()-1]='#';\n            ans++;\n        }\n    }\n    cout << ans;\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "greedy", "strings"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
