When you\r\npronounce letters, the machine will inscribe them onto a piece of paper.\r\nFor example, if you pronounce \u2019c\u2019, \u2019o\u2019, \u2019d\u2019, and \u2019e\u2019 in that order, then\r\nthe machine will inscribe \"\" onto the paper. Thanks to this machine, she\r\ncan finally write messages without using her glasses.However, her dumb\r\nfriend Akko decided to play a prank on her. Akko tinkered with the\r\nmachine so that if you pronounce \u2019w\u2019, it will inscribe \"\" instead of \"\",\r\nand if you pronounce \u2019m\u2019, it will inscribe \"\" instead of \"\"! Since\r\nConstanze had bad eyesight, she was not able to realize what Akko\r\ndid.The rest of the letters behave the same as before: if you pronounce\r\nany letter besides \u2019w\u2019 and \u2019m\u2019, the machine will just inscribe it onto a\r\npiece of paper.The next day, I received a letter in my mailbox. I can\u2019t\r\nunderstand it so I think it\u2019s either just some gibberish from Akko, or\r\nConstanze made it using her machine. But since I know what Akko did, I\r\ncan just list down all possible strings that Constanze\u2019s machine would\r\nhave turned into the message I got and see if anything makes sense.But I\r\nneed to know how much paper I will need, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you\r\nfor help. Tell me the number of strings that Constanze\u2019s machine\r\nwould\u2019ve turned into the message I got.But since this number can be\r\nquite large, tell me instead its remainder when divided by 10^9+7.If\r\nthere are no strings that Constanze\u2019s machine would\u2019ve turned into the\r\nmessage I got, then print 0.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nchar s[101010];\nint dp[101010];\nconst int MOD = 1e9+7;\nint main()\n{\n    dp[0] = 1;\n    scanf(\"%s\", s+1);\n    int N = strlen(s+1);\n    for(int i=1; i<=N; ++i)\n    {\n        if(s[i] == 'm' || s[i] == 'w')\n        {\n            puts(\"0\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1];\n        if(i!=1&&(s[i] == 'n'&&s[i-1]=='n' || s[i]=='u'&&s[i-1]=='u'))\n            dp[i] = (dp[i-2]+dp[i])%MOD;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", dp[N]);\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["dp"], "dificulty": "1400", "interactive": false}
