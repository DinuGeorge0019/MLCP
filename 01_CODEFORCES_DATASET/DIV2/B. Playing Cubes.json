Playing Cubes", "statement": "Petya and Vasya decided to play a little. They found red cubes and blue\r\ncubes. The game goes like that: the players take turns to choose a cube\r\nof some color (red or blue) and put it in a line from left to right\r\n(overall the line will have cubes). Petya moves first. Petya\u2019s task is\r\nto get as many pairs of neighbouring cubes of the same color as\r\npossible. Vasya\u2019s task is to get as many pairs of neighbouring cubes of\r\ndifferent colors as possible. The number of Petya\u2019s points in the game\r\nis the number of pairs of neighboring cubes of the same color in the\r\nline, the number of Vasya\u2019s points in the game is the number of\r\nneighbouring cubes of the different color in the line. Your task is to\r\ncalculate the score at the end of the game (Petya\u2019s and Vasya\u2019s points,\r\ncorrespondingly), if both boys are playing optimally well. To \"play\r\noptimally well\" first of all means to maximize the number of one\u2019s\r\npoints, and second to minimize the number of the opponent\u2019s points.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint n, m, temp;\n\nint main()\n{\n\tscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\tif (n > m)\n\t\ttemp = n, n = m, m = temp;\n\tprintf(\"%d %d\\n\", m - 1, n);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["games", "greedy", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1300", "interactive": false}
