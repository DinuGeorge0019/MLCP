On the\r\none-dimensional canvas split into consecutive segments, each segment\r\nneeds to be painted in one of the colours.Arkady has already painted\r\nsome (possibly none or all) segments and passes the paintbrush to you.\r\nYou are to determine whether there are at least two ways of colouring\r\nall the unpainted segments so that no two adjacent segments are of the\r\nsame colour. Two ways are considered different if and only if a segment\r\nis painted in different colours in them.\r\n",

    "editorial": "The problem can be solved in different approaches. Here we describe one\r\nbased on manually finding out all cases.What causes the answer to be\r\n\"Yes\"? Of course, there cannot be adjacent segments that already have\r\nthe same colour; but what else?We can figure out that whenever two\r\nconsecutive question marks appear, there are at least two ways to fill\r\nthem.But the samples lead us to ponder over cases with one single\r\nquestion mark: a question mark can be coloured in two different colours\r\nif it lies on the boundary of the canvas, or is between two adjacent\r\nsegments of the same colour.Putting it all together, we get a simple but\r\ncorrect solution.There surely are dynamic programming solutions to this\r\nproblem, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like a harder version, try this USACO problem. So\r\nto me seems like a notorious coincidence ._.\r\n"
