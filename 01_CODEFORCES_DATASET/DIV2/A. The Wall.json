You can consider\r\nthe wall being made of a very large number of bricks, numbered , , and\r\nso on. Iahub has the following scheme of painting: he skips consecutive\r\nbricks, then he paints the -th one. That is, he\u2019ll paint bricks , , and\r\nso on red. Similarly, Floyd skips consecutive bricks, then he paints the\r\n-th one. Hence he\u2019ll paint bricks , , and so on pink.After painting the\r\nwall all day, the boys observed that some bricks are painted both red\r\nand pink. Iahub has a lucky number and Floyd has a lucky number . Boys\r\nwonder how many bricks numbered no less than and no greater than are\r\npainted both red and pink. This is exactly your task: compute and print\r\nthe answer to the question.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <vector>\n#define FOR(i,a,b) for(int i = (a); i <= (b); i++)\n#define FR(i,a) for(int i = 0; i < (a); i++)\nusing namespace std;\n#define maxn 200100\nlong long x,y,A,B;\n\nlong long get(long long X) {\n    long long d = __gcd(x,y);\n    long long LCM = x*y / d;\n    return X/LCM;\n}\nint main() {\n    //freopen(\"A.in\",\"r\",stdin);\n    //freopen(\"A.out\",\"w\",stdout);\n    cin >> x >> y >> A >> B;\n    cout << get(B) - get(A-1) << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
