Candies for Children", "statement": "At the children\u2019s festival, children were dancing in a circle. When\r\nmusic stopped playing, the children were still standing in a circle.\r\nThen Lena remembered, that her parents gave her a candy box with exactly\r\nk candies \"Wilky May\". Lena is not a greedy person, so she decided to\r\npresent all her candies to her friends in the circle. Lena knows, that\r\nsome of her friends have a sweet tooth and others do not. Sweet tooth\r\ntakes out of the box two candies, if the box has at least two candies,\r\nand otherwise takes one. The rest of Lena\u2019s friends always take exactly\r\none candy from the box.Before starting to give candies, Lena step out of\r\nthe circle, after that there were exactly n people remaining there. Lena\r\nnumbered her friends in a clockwise order with positive integers\r\nstarting with 1 in such a way that index 1 was assigned to her best\r\nfriend Roma.Initially, Lena gave the box to the friend with number l,\r\nafter that each friend (starting from friend number l) took candies from\r\nthe box and passed the box to the next friend in clockwise order. The\r\nprocess ended with the friend number r taking the last candy (or two,\r\nwho knows) and the empty box. Please note that it is possible that some\r\nof Lena\u2019s friends took candy from the box several times, that is, the\r\nbox could have gone several full circles before becoming empty.Lena does\r\nnot know which of her friends have a sweet tooth, but she is interested\r\nin the maximum possible number of friends that can have a sweet tooth.\r\nIf the situation could not happen, and Lena have been proved wrong in\r\nher observations, please tell her about this.\r\n", "solutions": ["//Williams Wu\n/*#include <EGE.h>  //\ufffd\ufffd\u037c\u0377\ufffd\u013c\ufffd\n#define
