There are cockroaches\r\nliving in Anatoly\u2019s room.Anatoly just made all his cockroaches to form a\r\nsingle line. As he is a perfectionist, he would like the colors of\r\ncockroaches in the line to . He has a can of black paint and a can of\r\nred paint. In one turn he can either swap any two cockroaches, or take\r\nany single cockroach and change it\u2019s color.Help Anatoly find out the\r\nminimum number of turns he needs to make the colors of cockroaches in\r\nthe line alternate.\r\n",

    "editorial": "We can notice that there are only two possible final coloring of cockroaches that satisfy the problem statement: rbrbrb... or brbrbr...\n\nLet\u0092s go through both of these variants.\n\nIn the each case let's count the number of red and black cockroaches which are not standing in their places. Let's denote these numbers as x and y. Then it is obvious that the min(x,?y) pairs of cockroaches need to be swapped and the rest should be repaint.\n\nIn other words, the result for a fixed final coloring is exactly min(x,?y)?+?max(x,?y)?-?min(x,?y)?=?max(x,?y). The final answer for the problem is the minimum between the answers for the first and the second colorings."
