Hard Work", "statement": "After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur\u2019s teacher found out that\r\nhe is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations\r\nfaster than him even using a super computer!Some days before the\r\ncontest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his\r\nstudents took part in the exam. The teacher gave them strings and asked\r\nthem to them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary\r\norder one after the other. For example from concatenating and we can get\r\nto or depending on the order of concatenation.Unfortunately enough, the\r\nteacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a\r\npre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.Now the\r\nteacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks\r\nhim to correct the students\u2019 papers.Shapur is not good at doing such a\r\ntime-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as\r\npossible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover,\r\nthe teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here\u2019s what\r\nthe teacher said: As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my\r\nstudents (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian\r\nMikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so\r\nto make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and\r\nall of the students\u2019 answers to Latin. As latin alphabet has much less\r\ncharacters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to\r\nthe answers, these include \"\", \"\" and \"\". These characters are my own\r\ninvention of course! And I call them . The length of all initial strings\r\nwas less than or equal to and the lengths of my students\u2019 answers are\r\nless than or equal to My son, not all students are genius as you are. It\r\nis quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some\r\ncharacters. For example they may write instead of . Don\u2019t be picky and\r\nignore these mistakes. Those signs which I previously talked to you\r\nabout are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in\r\nthe mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something\r\nlike is the same as You should indicate for any of my students if his\r\nanswer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"\" for Wrong answer or \"\"\r\nfor a correct answer. I should remind you that none of the strings\r\n(initial strings or answers) are empty. Finally, do these as soon as\r\npossible. You have less than hours to complete this.\r\n", "solutions": ["# include <cstdio>\n# include <cctype>\n# include <cstring>\n\nchar inp1[101],inp2[101],inp3[101];\nchar check[6][301];\nchar student[601];\n\nvoid generate(char *i1,char *i2,char *i3,char* out)\n{\n\tstrcpy(out,i1);\n\tstrcat(out,i2);\n\tstrcat(out,i3);\n}\n\nvoid modify(char *inp)\n{\n\tint pos=0;\n\tfor(int i=0;inp[i];i++)\n\t\tif(isalpha(inp[i]))\n\t\t\tinp[pos++]=tolower(inp[i]);\n\tinp[pos]=0;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n\tscanf(\"%s%s%s\",inp1,inp2,inp3);\n\n\tmodify(inp1);\n\tmodify(inp2);\n\tmodify(inp3);\n\t\n\tgenerate(inp1,inp2,inp3,check[0]);\n\tgenerate(inp1,inp3,inp2,check[1]);\n\tgenerate(inp2,inp1,inp3,check[2]);\n\tgenerate(inp2,inp3,inp1,check[3]);\n\tgenerate(inp3,inp2,inp1,check[4]);\n\tgenerate(inp3,inp1,inp2,check[5]);\n\t\n\tint N;\n\tscanf(\"%d\",&N);\n\t\n\tfor(int i=0;i<N;i++)\n\t{\n\t\tscanf(\"%s\",student);\n\t\tmodify(student);\n\t\tfor(int j=0;j<6;j++)\n\t\t\tif(strcmp(student,check[j])==0)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tprintf(\"ACC\\n\");\n\t\t\t\tgoto bpp;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tprintf(\"WA\\n\");\n\t\tbpp:;\n\t}\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["strings"], "dificulty": "1300", "interactive": false}
