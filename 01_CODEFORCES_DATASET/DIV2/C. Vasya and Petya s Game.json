After receiving all the answers\r\nPetya should determine the number that Vasya thought of.Unfortunately,\r\nPetya is not familiar with the number theory. Help him find the minimum\r\nnumber of questions he should ask to make a guaranteed guess of Vasya\u2019s\r\nnumber, and the numbers , he should ask the questions about.\r\n",

It's easy to prove that this sequence actually guesses all the numbers from 1 to n\n\nThe complexity is O(N1.5) or O(NloglogN) depending on primality test."
