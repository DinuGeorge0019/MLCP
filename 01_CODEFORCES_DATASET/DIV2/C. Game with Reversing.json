    "statement": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have two strings S and T of the\r\nsame length n consisting of lowercase latin letters. Players take turns\r\nalternately, with Alice going first.On her turn, Alice chooses an\r\ninteger i from 1 to n, one of the strings S or T, and any lowercase\r\nlatin letter c, and replaces the i-th symbol in the chosen string with\r\nthe character c.On his turn, Bob chooses one of the strings S or T, and\r\nreverses it. More formally, Bob makes the replacement S :=\r\noperatorname{rev}(S) or T :=\r\noperatorname{rev}(T), where\r\noperatorname{rev}(P) = P_n P_{n-1}\r\nldots P_1.The game lasts until the strings S and T are equal. As soon as\r\nthe strings become equal, the game .Define as the total number of moves\r\nmade by both players during the game. For example, if Alice made 2 moves\r\nin total, and Bob made 1 move, then the duration of this game is\r\n3.Alice’s goal is to minimize the duration of the game, and Bob’s goal\r\nis to maximize the duration of the game.What will be the duration of the\r\ngame, if both players play optimally? It can be shown that the game will\r\nend in a finite number of turns.\r\n",

    "editorial": "Letâs show that the specific choice of a turn by Bob (which of the\r\nstrings to reverse) does not affect Aliceâs strategy and therefore the\r\nanswer to the problem.Reversing the string does not change anything we\r\nare only interested in the parity of the number of reverses for both\r\nstrings.If Bob made an even number of moves in total, then the parity of\r\nthe number of moves made by Bob with string coincides with the parity of\r\nthe number of moves made by Bob with string pairs of characters at the\r\nsame indices, after all reverses, will be , possibly in reverse order,\r\nbut it doesnât matter. Here and are the original indices of the strings,\r\nwhich do not change with reversing.If Bob made an odd number of moves,\r\nthen exactly one of the strings will be reversed, and the pairs of\r\ncharacters in the same indices will be: (or in reverse order).That is,\r\nthe specific pairs of corresponding characters are determined only by\r\nthe parity of the total number of moves made by Bob, and it does not\r\nmatter which specific moves were made.Therefore, Alice can choose one of\r\ntwo strategies: Make , and fix the end of the game when the number of\r\nmoves made by Bob is even. Make , and fix the end of the game when the\r\nnumber of moves made by Bob is odd.Letâs count the number of indices\r\nwhere and differ, and the number of indices where and differ.For the\r\nfirst strategy, Alice must make at least moves herself, and it is also\r\nnecessary that the number of moves made by Bob is even it is easy to see\r\nthat for this strategy the game will last moves.For the second strategy,\r\neverything is roughly similar: the game will last moves, but the case\r\nneeds to be handled separately.And the answer to the problem will be the\r\nminimum of these two values.
