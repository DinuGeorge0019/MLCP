Warrior and Archer", "statement": "Vova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova\u2019s place and compete\r\nagainst each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri:\r\nSwordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac\r\nchooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for\r\ntheir characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat,\r\nso Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as\r\npossible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha\r\nwill try to make the initial distance as large as possible.There are (\r\nis always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along\r\nthe axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates , two\r\ncharacters cannot end up at the same position.Vova and Lesha take turns\r\nbanning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of\r\nthe guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions\r\ncannot be used by Vova and Lesha. They continue to make moves until\r\nthere are only two possible positions remaining (thus, the total number\r\nof moves will be ). After that Vova\u2019s character takes the position with\r\nthe lesser coordinate and Lesha\u2019s character takes the position with the\r\nbigger coordinate and the guys start fighting.Vova and Lesha are already\r\ntired by the game of choosing positions, as they need to play it before\r\nevery fight, so they asked you (the developer of the The Ancient Papyri:\r\nSwordsink) to write a module that would automatically determine the\r\ndistance at which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both\r\nVova and Lesha play optimally.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <map>\n#include <vector>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <iomanip>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {\n    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    vector<int> x(n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        cin >> x[i];\n    }\n    \n    sort(x.begin(), x.end());\n    \n    int res = 1000000000;\n    \n    int d = (n - 2) / 2 + 1;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i + d < n; ++i) {\n        res = min(res, x[i + d] - x[i]);\n    }\n    \n    cout << res;\n    \n    return 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["games"], "dificulty": "2300", "interactive": false}
