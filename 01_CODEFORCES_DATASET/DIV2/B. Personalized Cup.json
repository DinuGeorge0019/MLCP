Personalized Cup", "statement": "At many competitions that have a word cup in its official name the\r\nwinner is presented with an actual cup. This time the organizers of one\r\nunusual programming competition have decided to please the winner even\r\nmore and to add a nameplate to the cup with the handle of the winner.The\r\nnameplate is to be rectangular and the text on it will be printed as a\r\ntable of several rows and columns. Having some measurements done, the\r\norganizers have found out that the number a of rows cannot be greater\r\nthan 5 while the number b of columns cannot exceed 20. Every cell of the\r\ntable will contain either an asterisk ( ) or a letter of user\u2019s\r\nhandle.Furthermore, the organizers want the rows of the table to be\r\nuniform, which means that the number of asterisks used in different rows\r\nshould differ by at most one (i.e. you can\u2019t have two asterisks in the\r\nfirst row and none in the second). The main goal, however, is to obtain\r\nthe winner\u2019s handle precisely when reading the table from top to bottom\r\nand from left to right in every row (skipping asterisks).The organizers\r\nwant for the nameplate to have as few rows as possible and among all\r\nvalid tables with the minimum number of rows they want to choose the one\r\nthat has the minimum number of columns.The winner is not yet determined\r\nso your task is to write a program that, given a certain handle,\r\ngenerates the necessary table.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint a[(int)2e5];\nint main()\n{\n    int n, k;\n    string s;\n    cin >> s;\n    k = s.size();\n    int t = 0;\n    for(int e = 1; e <= 5; e++)\n        if((k + e - 1) / e <= 20)\n        {\n            t = e;\n            break;\n        }\n    cout << t << ' '<<(k + t - 1) / t<<endl;\n    int it = 0;\n   // cout << k << endl;\n    for(int i = 1; i<= t;i++)\n    {\n        int x = (k ) / t;\n        if(i <= (k) % t)\n            x++;\n        else\n            if((k) % t)\n                cout<<'*';\n        for(int j = 1; j <= x;j++)\n        {\n            cout<<s[it++];\n        }\n        cout<<endl;\n    }\n\n}\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": [], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
