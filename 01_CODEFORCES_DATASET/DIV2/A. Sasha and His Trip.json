They are all located on\r\none straight line, and for convenience, they are numbered from 1 to n in\r\nincreasing order. The distance between any two adjacent cities is equal\r\nto 1 kilometer. Since all roads in the country are directed, it\u2019s\r\npossible to reach the city y from the city x only if x < y. Once Sasha\r\ndecided to go on a trip around the country and to visit all n cities. He\r\nwill move with the help of his car, . The tank capacity of this model is\r\nv liters, and it spends exactly 1 liter of fuel for 1 kilometer of the\r\nway. At the beginning of the journey, the tank is empty. Sasha is\r\nlocated in the city with the number 1 and wants to get to the city with\r\nthe number n. There is a gas station in each city. In the i-th city, the\r\nprice of 1 liter of fuel is i dollars. It is obvious that at any moment\r\nof time, the tank can contain at most v liters of fuel.Sasha doesn\u2019t\r\nlike to waste money, that\u2019s why he wants to know what is the minimum\r\namount of money is needed to finish the trip if he can buy fuel in any\r\ncity he wants. Help him to figure it out!\r\n",

Else you must notice, that it is optimal to fill\r\nthe tank as soon as possible, because if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that, you will\r\nhave to spend more money in future. So to drive first kilometers just\r\nbuy liters in the first city, then to drive between cities with numbers\r\nand , buy liter in the city with number .\r\n"
