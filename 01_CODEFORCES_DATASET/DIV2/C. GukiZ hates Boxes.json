In total there are piles of\r\nboxes, arranged in a line, from left to right, -th pile () containing\r\nboxes. Luckily, students are willing to help GukiZ by removing all the\r\nboxes from his way. Students are working simultaneously. At time , all\r\nstudents are located left of the first pile. It takes one second for\r\nevery student to move from this position to the first pile, and after\r\nthat, every student must start performing sequence of two possible\r\noperations, each taking one second to complete. Possible operations are:\r\nIf , move from pile to pile ; If pile located at the position of student\r\nis not empty, remove one box from it.GukiZ\u2019s students aren\u2019t smart at\r\nall, so they need you to tell them how to remove boxes before professor\r\ncomes (he is very impatient man, and doesn\u2019t want to wait). They ask you\r\nto calculate minumum time in seconds for which they can remove all the\r\nboxes from GukiZ\u2019s way. Note that students can be positioned in any\r\nmanner after seconds, but all the boxes must be removed.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <vector>\n#include <stack>\n#include <queue>\n#include <deque>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n\n#define pb push_back\n#define mp make_pair\n#define LL long long\n#define LD long double\n#define maxlongint 2147483647\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int inf = 999999999;\nconst int mod = 1000000007;\n\ninline int Getint()\n{\n    char ch = getchar();\n    while (ch < '0' || ch > '9') ch = getchar();\n    int ret = 0;\n    while (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9') ret = ret * 10 + ch - '0', ch = getchar();\n    return ret;\n}\n\nint a[100010], b[100010];\nint n, m;\n\nint main()\n{\n    n = Getint(), m = Getint();\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) a[i] = Getint();\n    while (!a[n]) n--;\n    LL l = n + 1, r = 1000000000000000LL, ans = 0;\n    while (l <= r)\n    {\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) b[i] = a[i];\n        LL mid = l + r >> 1, rest = 0;\n        int where = n;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)\n        {\n            rest += mid - (where + 1);\n            b[where]--;\n            while (1)\n            {\n                if (b[where] <= rest)\n                {\n                    rest -= b[where];\n                    b[where--] = 0;\n                    if (!where) break;\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    b[where] -= rest;\n                    rest = 0;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (!where) break;\n        }\n        if (!where) ans = mid, r = mid - 1; else l = mid + 1;\n    }\n    printf(\"%I64d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["binary search", "greedy"], "dificulty": "2200", "interactive": false}
