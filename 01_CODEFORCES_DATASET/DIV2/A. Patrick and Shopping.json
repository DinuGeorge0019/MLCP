He should visit both shops moving only along\r\nthe three existing roads and return back to his house. He doesn\u2019t mind\r\nvisiting the same shop or passing the same road multiple times. The only\r\ngoal is to minimize the total distance traveled.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n  int d1, d2, d3;\n  scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &d1, &d2, &d3);\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", min(d1 * 2 + d2 * 2, min(min(d1, d2) * 2 + d3 * 2, d1 + d2 + d3)));\n  return 0;\n}\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "800", "interactive": false}
