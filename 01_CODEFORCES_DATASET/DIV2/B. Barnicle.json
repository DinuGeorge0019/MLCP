Barney asked the bar tender\r\nCarl about this distance value, but Carl was so busy talking to the\r\ncustomers so he wrote the distance value (it\u2019s a real number) on a\r\nnapkin. The problem is that he wrote it in scientific notation. The\r\nscientific notation of some real number is the notation of form , where\r\nis a real number and is an integer and is true. In our case is between\r\nand and is non-negative.Barney doesn\u2019t know anything about scientific\r\nnotation (as well as anything scientific at all). So he asked you to\r\ntell him the distance value in usual decimal representation with minimal\r\nnumber of digits after the decimal point (and no decimal point if it is\r\nan integer).
