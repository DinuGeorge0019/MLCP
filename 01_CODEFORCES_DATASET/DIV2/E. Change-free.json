Prices in the canteen do not change and that\r\nmeans Arseny will spend rubles during the -th day.There are -ruble coins\r\nand -ruble notes in circulation. At this moment, Arseny has coins and a\r\nsufficiently large amount of notes (you can assume that he has an\r\ninfinite amount of them). Arseny loves modern technologies, so he uses\r\nhis credit card everywhere except the canteen, but he has to pay in cash\r\nin the canteen because it does not accept cards.Cashier always asks the\r\nstudent to pay change-free. However, it\u2019s not always possible, but\r\nArseny tries to minimize the of the cashier. Cashier\u2019s dissatisfaction\r\nfor each of the days is determined by the total amount of notes and\r\ncoins in the change. To be precise, if the cashier gives Arseny notes\r\nand coins on the -th day, his dissatisfaction for this day equals .\r\nCashier always gives change using as little coins and notes as possible,\r\nhe always has enough of them to be able to do this. Arseny wants to pay\r\nin such a way that the total dissatisfaction of the cashier for days\r\nwould be as small as possible. Help him to find out how he needs to pay\r\nin each of the days!Note that Arseny always has enough money to pay,\r\nbecause he has an infinite amount of notes. Arseny can use notes and\r\ncoins he received in change during any of the following days.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<queue>\n#include<cstdio>\nusing namespace std;\n#define ran 1111111\nint n;\nlong long int m;\nlong long int c[ran],w[ran],d[ran];\npriority_queue<pair<long long int,int> > q;\nbool f[ran];\nint main(){\n\tscanf(\"%d%I64d\",&n,&m);\n\tfor(int i=0; i<n; i++){\n\t\tscanf(\"%I64d\",&c[i]);\n\t\td[i] = c[i] % 100;\n\t\tf[i] = false;\n\t}\n\tfor(int i=0; i<n; i++)\n\t\tscanf(\"%I64d\",&w[i]);\n\twhile(!q.empty())q.pop();\n\tlong long int res = 0;\n\tfor(int i=0; i<n; i++){\n\t\tif(d[i] != 0){\n\t\t\tq.push(make_pair(-w[i] * (100 - d[i]),i));\n\t\t}\n\t\tm -= d[i];\n\t\tif(m < 0){\n\t\t\tm += 100;\n\t\t\tres -= q.top().first;\n\t\t\tf[q.top().second] = true;\n\t\t\tq.pop();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tprintf(\"%I64d\\n\",res);\n\tfor(int i=0; i<n; i++)\n\t\tif(!f[i])\n\t\t\tprintf(\"%I64d %I64d\\n\",c[i]/100,c[i]%100);\n\t\telse\n\t\t\tprintf(\"%I64d %I64d\\n\",c[i]/100+1,0);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy"], "dificulty": "2400", "interactive": false}
