    "statement": "There is a pyramid which consists of n floors. The floors are numbered\r\nfrom top to bottom in increasing order. In the pyramid, the i-th floor\r\nconsists of i rooms.Denote the j-th room on the i-th floor as (i,j). For\r\nall positive integers i and j such that 1\r\nle j\r\nle i < n, there are 2 staircases which lead from (i,j) to (i+1,j) and\r\nfrom (i,j) to (i+1,j+1) respectively.In each room you can either put a\r\ntorch or leave it empty. Define the of a room (i, j) to be the number of\r\nrooms with a torch from which you can reach the room (i, j) through a\r\nnon-negative number of staircases.For example, when n=5 and torches are\r\nplaced in the rooms (1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,3), and (5,3), the\r\npyramid can be illustrated as follows: In the above picture, rooms with\r\ntorches are colored in yellow, and empty rooms are white. The blue\r\nnumbers in the bottom-right corner indicate the brightness of the\r\nrooms.The room (4,2) (the room with a star) has brightness 3. In the\r\npicture below, the rooms from where you can reach (4,2) have red border.\r\nThe brightness is 3 since there are three torches among these rooms. The\r\npyramid is called if and only if for all floors, all rooms in the floor\r\nhave the same brightness.Define the of a nice pyramid to be the sum of\r\nbrightness over the rooms (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (n,1).Find an\r\narrangement of torches in the pyramid, such that the resulting pyramid\r\nis nice and its brilliance is maximized.We can show that an answer\r\nalways exists. If there are multiple answers, output any one of them.\r\n",
