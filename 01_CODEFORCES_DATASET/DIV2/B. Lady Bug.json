    "statement": "As soon as Dasha Purova crossed the border of France, the villain\r\nMarkaron kidnapped her and placed her in a prison under his large\r\ncastle. Fortunately, the wonderful Lady Bug, upon hearing the news about\r\nDasha, immediately ran to save her in Markaronâ€™s castle. However, to get\r\nthere, she needs to crack a complex password.The password consists of\r\ntwo bit strings a and b, each of which has a length of n. In one\r\noperation, Lady Bug can choose any index 2\r\nle i\r\nle n and perform one of the following actions: swap(a_i, b_{i-1}) (swap\r\nthe values of a_i and b_{i-1}), or swap(b_i, a_{i-1}) (swap the values\r\nof b_i and a_{i-1}). Lady Bug can perform any number of operations. The\r\npassword is considered cracked if she can ensure that the first string\r\nconsists only of zeros. Help her understand whether or not she will be\r\nable to save the unfortunate Dasha.\r\n",
