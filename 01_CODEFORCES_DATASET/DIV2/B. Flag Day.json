In the\r\nhonor of this event the president of the country decided to make a big\r\ndance party and asked your agency to organize it. He has several\r\nconditions: overall, there must be dances; exactly three people must\r\ntake part in each dance; each dance must have one dancer in white\r\nclothes, one dancer in red clothes and one dancer in blue clothes (these\r\nare the colors of the national flag of Berland). The agency has dancers,\r\nand their number can be less than . That is, some dancers will probably\r\nhave to dance in more than one dance. All of your dancers must dance on\r\nthe party. However, if some dance has two or more dancers from a\r\nprevious dance, then the current dance stops being spectacular. Your\r\nagency cannot allow that to happen, so each dance has at most one dancer\r\nwho has danced in some previous dance. You considered all the criteria\r\nand made the plan for the dances: each dance had three dancers\r\nparticipating in it. Your task is to determine the clothes color for\r\neach of the dancers so that the President\u2019s third condition fulfilled:\r\neach dance must have a dancer in white, a dancer in red and a dancer in\r\nblue. The dancers cannot change clothes between the dances.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\nconst int V=100100;\nint c[V];\nint n,m,x,y,z;\nint main()\n{\n    while(~scanf(\"%d%d\",&n,&m))\n    {\n        memset(c,0,sizeof(c));\n        while(m--)\n        {\n            scanf(\"%d%d%d\",&x,&y,&z);\n            if(c[x]!=0)\n            {\n                c[y]=c[x]%3+1;\n                c[z]=c[y]%3+1;\n            }\n            else if(c[y]!=0)\n            {\n                c[z]=c[y]%3+1;\n                c[x]=c[z]%3+1;\n            }\n            else if(c[z]!=0)\n            {\n                c[x]=c[z]%3+1;\n                c[y]=c[x]%3+1;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                c[x]=1;\n                c[y]=2;\n                c[z]=3;\n            }\n        }\n        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\n        printf(\"%d \",c[i]);puts(\"\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1400", "interactive": false}
