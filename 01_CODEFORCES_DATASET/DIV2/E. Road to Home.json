All of\r\nthe lightened segments do not share common points.Danil loves to sing,\r\nthus he wants to sing his favourite song over and over again during his\r\nwalk. As soon as non-lightened segments of the road scare him, he sings\r\nonly when he goes through the lightened segments.Danil passes distance\r\nwhile performing his favourite song once. Danil can\u2019t start another\r\nperformance if the segment passed while performing is not fully\r\nlightened. Moreover, if Danil has taken a pause between two\r\nperformances, he is not performing while not having passed a segment of\r\nlength at least . Formally, Danil can start single performance at a\r\npoint only if every point of segment is lightened; If Danil has finished\r\nperforming at a point , then the next performance can be started only at\r\na point such that or satisfying the statement under the point .\r\nDetermine how many times Danil can perform his favourite song during his\r\nwalk from to .Please note that Danil does not break a single\r\nperformance, thus, started singing another time, he finishes singing\r\nwhen having a segment of length of passed from the performance start\r\npoint.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#define ll long long\n#define N 100005\nusing namespace std;\n\nint m,n,p,t,f[N],g[N];\nvoid up(int k,int w,int x,int y){\n\tif (w+(y-x)/p>f[k]){\n\t\tf[k]=w+(y-x)/p; g[k]=x+(y-x)/p*p;\n\t} else if (w+(y-x)/p==f[k]){\n\t\tg[k]=min(g[k],x+(y-x)/p*p);\n\t}\n}\nint main(){\n\tscanf(\"%d%d%d%d\",&m,&n,&p,&t);\n\tint now=0,i,ans=0,x,y;\n\tg[0]=-t;\n\tfor (i=1; i<=n; i++){\n\t\tscanf(\"%d%d\",&x,&y);\n\t\tif (now) now--;\n\t\tfor (; now<i && g[now]+t<=y; now++){\n\t\t\tif (g[now]+t<=x) up(i,f[now],x,y); else up(i,f[now],g[now]+t,y);\n\t\t}\n\t\tans=max(ans,f[i]);\n\t\tif (f[i-1]>f[i]){ f[i]=f[i-1]; g[i]=g[i-1]; }\n\t\telse if (f[i-1]==f[i]) g[i]=min(g[i],g[i-1]);\n\t}\n\tprintf(\"%d\\n\",ans);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["binary search", "dp"], "dificulty": "2700", "interactive": false}
