Testing Pants for Sadness", "statement": "The average miner Vaganych took refresher courses. As soon as a miner\r\ncompletes the courses, he should take exams. The hardest one is a\r\ncomputer test called \"Testing Pants for Sadness\".The test consists of\r\nquestions; the questions are to be answered strictly in the order in\r\nwhich they are given, from question to question . Question contains\r\nanswer variants, exactly one of them is correct. A click is regarded as\r\nselecting any answer in any question. The goal is to select the correct\r\nanswer for each of the questions. If Vaganych selects a wrong answer for\r\nsome question, then all selected answers become unselected and the test\r\nstarts from the very beginning, from question again. But Vaganych\r\nremembers everything. The order of answers for each question and the\r\norder of questions remain unchanged, as well as the question and answers\r\nthemselves.Vaganych is very smart and his memory is superb, yet he is\r\nunbelievably unlucky and knows nothing whatsoever about the test\u2019s\r\ntheme. How many clicks will he have to perform in the worst case?\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    long long n,ans,x;\n\n    ans=0;\n    while(scanf(\"%I64d\",&n)==1)\n    {\n        ans=0;\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)\n        {\n            scanf(\"%I64d\",&x);\n            //printf(\"%I64d \",x);\n            ans+=i*(x-1)+x;\n        }\n        printf(\"%I64d\\n\",ans);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math"], "dificulty": "1100", "interactive": false}
