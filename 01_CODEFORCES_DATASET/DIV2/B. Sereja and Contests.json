Two rounds, and , can go\r\nsimultaneously, ( round cannot be held without ) in all other cases the\r\nrounds don’t overlap in time. Each round has a unique identifier a\r\npositive integer. The rounds are sequentially (without gaps) numbered\r\nwith identifiers by the starting time of the round. The identifiers of\r\nrounds that are run simultaneously are different by one, also the\r\nidentifier of the round is always greater.Sereja is a beginner coder, so\r\nhe can take part only in rounds of type. At the moment he is taking part\r\nin a round, its identifier equals to . Sereja remembers very well that\r\nhe has taken part in exactly rounds before this round. Also, he\r\nremembers all identifiers of the rounds he has taken part in and all\r\nidentifiers of the rounds that went simultaneously with them. Sereja\r\ndoesn’t remember anything about the rounds he missed.Sereja is\r\nwondering: what minimum and what maximum number of rounds could he have\r\nmissed? Help him find these two numbers.\r\n",
