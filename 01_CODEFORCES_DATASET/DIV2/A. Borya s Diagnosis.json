Constraints are pretty low, so we can use almost any reasonable\r\nway.For example, we can just go through all the days, starting from the\r\ncurrent one, and check if the doctor is working on that day. At the step\r\nwe need to go through at most days.There is a more efficient way. We can\r\nfind the smallest that is greater than the current day, such that , in .\r\nIf , Borya will visit a doctor on day , otherwise on day . This solution\r\nis .\r\n"
