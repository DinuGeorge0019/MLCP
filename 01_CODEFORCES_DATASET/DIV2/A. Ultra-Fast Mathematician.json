He was great at everything\r\nincluding Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus,\r\netc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to\r\nsum numbers in a single second.One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to\r\nfind out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a\r\nresult he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take\r\npart.In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of\r\nnumbers. Each number is made from digits or . The contestants should\r\nwrite a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule\r\nis simple: The -th digit of the answer is if and only if the -th digit\r\nof the two given numbers differ. In the other case the -th digit of the\r\nanswer is .Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He\r\nsaw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length (length of\r\na number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct\r\nanswers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He\r\nis a good fellow so he won\u2019t give anyone very big numbers and he always\r\ngives one person numbers of same length.Now you are going to take part\r\nin Shapur\u2019s contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\r\n", "solutions": ["# include <cstdio>\n\nchar inp1[101],inp2[101];\n\nint main()\n{\n\tscanf(\"%s%s\",inp1,inp2);\n\tfor(int i=0;inp1[i];i++)\n\t\tif(inp1[i]==inp2[i])\n\t\t\tprintf(\"0\");\n\t\telse\n\t\t\tprintf(\"1\");\n\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "800", "interactive": false}
