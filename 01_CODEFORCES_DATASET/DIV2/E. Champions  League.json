Champions  League", "statement": "In the autumn of this year, two Russian teams came into the group stage\r\nof the most prestigious football club competition in the world the UEFA\r\nChampions League. Now, these teams have already started to play in the\r\ngroup stage and are fighting for advancing to the playoffs. In this\r\nproblem we are interested in the draw stage, the process of sorting\r\nteams into groups.The process of the draw goes as follows (the rules\r\nthat are described in this problem, are somehow simplified compared to\r\nthe real life). Suppose teams will take part in the group stage ( is\r\ndivisible by four). The teams should be divided into groups of four.\r\nLet\u2019s denote the number of groups as (). Each team has a rating an\r\ninteger characterizing the team\u2019s previous achievements. The teams are\r\nsorted by the rating\u2019s decreasing (no two teams have the same\r\nrating).After that four \"baskets\" are formed, each of which will contain\r\nteams: the first teams with the highest rating go to the first basket,\r\nthe following teams go to the second one, and so on.Then the following\r\nprocedure repeats times. A team is randomly taken from each basket,\r\nfirst from the first basket, then from the second, then from the third,\r\nand at last, from the fourth. The taken teams form another group. After\r\nthat, they are from their baskets.The four teams remaining in the\r\nbaskets after such procedures are performed, form the last group.In the\r\nreal draw the random selection of teams from the basket is performed by\r\npeople as a rule, the well-known players of the past. As we have none,\r\nwe will use a random number generator, which is constructed as follows.\r\nIts parameters are four positive integers . Every time there is a call\r\nto the random number generator, it produces the following actions:\r\ncalculates ; replaces parameter by value (assigns ); returns as another\r\nrandom number. Operation means taking the remainder after division: , .A\r\nrandom number generator will be used in the draw as follows: each time\r\nwe need to randomly choose a team from the basket, it will generate a\r\nrandom number . The teams that yet remain in the basket are considered\r\nnumbered with consecutive integers from to , in the order of decreasing\r\nrating, where is the current size of the basket. Then a team number is\r\ntaken from the basket.Given a list of teams and the parameters of the\r\nrandom number generator, determine the result of the draw.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<stdio.h>\n#include<stdlib.h>\n#include<string.h>\n#include<math.h>\n#include<algorithm>\n#include<set>\n#include<map>\n#include<vector>\n#include<string>\n#include<iostream>\n#include<sstream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int maxn = 100 + 10;\n\nint x, a, b, c;\nint n;\n\nvector<pair<int, string> > B[4];\npair<int, string> T[70];\nvector<pair<int, string> > G[70];\n\npair<int, string> pick(vector<pair<int, string> > & B) {\n\tx = (x * a + b) % c;\n\tint id = x % B.size();\n\tpair<int, string> res = B[id];\n\tB.erase(B.begin() + id);\n\treturn res;\n}\n\nint main() {\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin); freopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n\tcin>>n;\n\tcin>>x>>a>>b>>c;\n\tfor(int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\t\tcin>>T[i].second>>T[i].first;\n\t}\n\tsort(T, T+n); reverse(T, T+n);\n\tint m = n/4;\n\tfor(int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\t\tB[i/m].push_back(T[i]);\n\t}\n\n\tfor(int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n\t\tfor(int j=0; j<4; j++) G[i].push_back(pick(B[j]));\n\t}\n\n\tfor(int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n\t\tcout<<\"Group \"<<(char)('A' + i)<<\":\"<<endl;\n\t\tfor(int j=0; j<4; j++) {\n\t\t\tcout<<G[i][j].second<<endl;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "1600", "interactive": false}
