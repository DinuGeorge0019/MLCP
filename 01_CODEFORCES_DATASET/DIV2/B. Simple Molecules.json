Today\r\nhe will attempt to join three atoms into one molecule.A molecule\r\nconsists of atoms, with some pairs of atoms connected by atomic bonds.\r\nEach atom has a valence number the number of bonds the atom must form\r\nwith other atoms. An atom can form bonds with any other atom, but it\r\ncannot form a bond with itself. The number of bonds of an atom in the\r\nmolecule must be equal to its valence number. Mike knows valence numbers\r\nof the three atoms. Find a molecule that can be built from these atoms\r\naccording to the stated rules, or determine that it is impossible.\r\n",

    "editorial": "First solution. First, the sum should be even, since each bond adds 2 to\r\nthe sum. Now let , , be the number of bonds between 1st and 2nd, 2nd and\r\n3rd, 3rd and 1st atoms, accordingly. So we have to solve the system , ,\r\n. Now observe that the solution to the system is the length of the\r\ntangents on the triangle with sides of length , , to its inscribed\r\ncircle, and are equal to , , . If the problem asked only the possibility\r\nof building such a molecule, we could just check if there exists\r\n(possibly degenerate) triangle with sides , , .
