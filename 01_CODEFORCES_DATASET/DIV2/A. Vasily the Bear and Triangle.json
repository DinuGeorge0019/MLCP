That’s why today he asks you to\r\nfind two points and , such that the following conditions hold: the\r\ncoordinates of points: , , , are integers. Besides, the following\r\ninequation holds: ; the triangle formed by point , and is rectangular\r\nand isosceles ( is right); all points of the favorite rectangle are\r\nlocated inside or on the border of triangle ; the area of triangle is as\r\nsmall as possible.
