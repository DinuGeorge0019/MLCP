    "statement": "Valera the Horse is going to the party with friends. He has been\r\nfollowing the fashion trends for a while, and he knows that it is very\r\npopular to wear all horseshoes of different color. Valera has got four\r\nhorseshoes left from the last year, but maybe some of them have the same\r\ncolor. In this case he needs to go to the store and buy some few more\r\nhorseshoes, not to lose face in front of his stylish\r\ncomrades.Fortunately, the store sells horseshoes of all colors under the\r\nsun and Valera has enough money to buy any four of them. However, in\r\norder to save the money, he would like to spend as little money as\r\npossible, so you need to help Valera and determine what is the minimum\r\nnumber of horseshoes he needs to buy to wear four horseshoes of\r\ndifferent colors to a party.\r\n",
