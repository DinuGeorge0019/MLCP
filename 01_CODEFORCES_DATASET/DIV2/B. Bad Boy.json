Bad Boy", "statement": "Riley is a very bad boy, but at the same time, he is a yo-yo master. So,\r\nhe decided to use his yo-yo skills to annoy his friend Anton.Anton\u2019s\r\nroom can be represented as a grid with n rows and m columns. Let (i, j)\r\ndenote the cell in row i and column j. Anton is currently standing at\r\nposition (i, j) in his room. To annoy Anton, Riley decided to throw\r\nexactly yo-yos in cells of the room (they can be in the same\r\ncell).Because Anton doesn\u2019t like yo-yos thrown on the floor, he has to\r\npick up both of them and return back to the initial position. The\r\ndistance travelled by Anton is the shortest path that goes through the\r\npositions of both yo-yos and returns back to (i, j) by travelling only\r\nto adjacent by side cells. That is, if he is in cell (x, y) then he can\r\ntravel to the cells (x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1) and (x, y - 1) in\r\none step (if a cell with those coordinates exists).Riley is wondering\r\nwhere he should throw these two yo-yos so that the distance travelled by\r\nAnton is . But because he is very busy, he asked you to tell him.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <set>\n#include <queue>\n#include <random>\n#include \"map\"\ntypedef double ld;\ntypedef long long ll;\n#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()\nusing namespace std;\nvoid solve() {\n    int n, m, i, j;\n    cin >> n >> m >> i >> j;\n    cout << \"1 1 \" << n << ' ' << m << '\\n';\n}\nsigned main() {\n    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(nullptr);\n    cout.tie(nullptr);\n    int q;\n    cin >> q;\n    while (q--) solve();\n}\n/*\n5 1\n0 1 2 2\n4 0\n1 1 1\n */"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "greedy", "math"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
