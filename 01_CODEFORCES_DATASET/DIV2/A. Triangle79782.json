Triangle", "statement": "Johnny has a younger sister Anne, who is very clever and smart. As she\r\ncame home from the kindergarten, she told his brother about the task\r\nthat her kindergartener asked her to solve. The task was just to\r\nconstruct a triangle out of four sticks of different colours. Naturally,\r\none of the sticks is extra. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use\r\ntheir partial length. Anne has perfectly solved this task, now she is\r\nasking Johnny to do the same.The boy answered that he would cope with it\r\nwithout any difficulty. However, after a while he found out that\r\ndifferent tricky things can occur. It can happen that it is impossible\r\nto construct a triangle of a positive area, but it is possible to\r\nconstruct a degenerate triangle. It can be so, that it is impossible to\r\nconstruct a degenerate triangle even. As Johnny is very lazy, he does\r\nnot want to consider such a big amount of cases, he asks you to help\r\nhim.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <algorithm>\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int a[4];\n    for (int i=0;i<4;i++) cin >> a[i];\n    sort(a,a+4);\n    if (a[0]+a[1]>a[2] || a[1]+a[2]>a[3]) {\n        cout << \"TRIANGLE\" << endl;\n        return 0;\n    }\n    if (a[0]+a[1]==a[2] || a[1]+a[2]==a[3]) {\n        cout << \"SEGMENT\" <<  endl;\n        return 0;\n    }\n    cout << \"IMPOSSIBLE\" << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "geometry"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
