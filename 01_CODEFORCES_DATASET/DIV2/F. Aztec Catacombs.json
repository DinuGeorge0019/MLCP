    "editorial": "Let us formualate a problem in terms of graph theory and make some observation. Denote the start and the finish vertices as s\n and t\n.\n\nObservation 1. If vertices s\n and t\n are connected with a simple path consisting of k\n edges, then by the statement of the problem Indiana Johns may use it leading us to the answer of length k\n. Thus, the answer does not exceed d\n where d\n is the length of the shortest path between s\n and t\n if s\n and t\n are connected and ?\n otherwise. Let us call path consisting only of the original edges of the graph trivial and the paths including originally non-existent edges non-trivial.\n\nObservation 2. The length of any non-trivial path is at least 4. Indeed, let s=v0??e1v2??e2???ekvk=t\n be the valid path in which some of the edges ei\n is missing in the original graph. Notice that the edge e1\n may not be missing as by the moment we follow it, nothing was flipped yet, and e2\n also may not be missing as it requires e2\n to be same with e1\n which was just flipped. Also note that e3\n may not be the last edge in our path because otherwise it must be missing in the original graph (since the path is non-trivial), and we did not visit vertex v2\n yet as v2?v1\n and v2?v0=1\n. Thus, k?4\n.\n\nObservation 3. If d?4\n, then the answer is d\n. It immediately follows from two previous observations: shortest trivial path has the length of d\n and shortest non-trivial has the length of at least 4\n.\n\n?????????? 4. If d?4\n and there exists a vertex v2\n at the distance of 2\n from v0=s\n, then there exists a non-trivial path of length 4\n. Indeed, v0?v1?v2?v0?t\n is such path where v1\n is a vertex through which the path of length 2\n between v0\n and v2\n passes. Finally, note that v2\n and v0\n are not initially connected (otherwise the distance between v0\n and v2\n would be 1), hence when we visit v2\n, the edge v2?v0\n is present. Similarly, by the moment of second visit of vertex v0\n originally missing edge v0?t\n appears.\n\nObservation 5. Any non-trivial path of length 4\n looks exactly as described in an observation 4, first two initially existent edges, then newly appeared edge leading to s\n and finally newly appeared edge leading to t\n. It immediately follows from the explanation of the observation 2.\n\nObservation 6. If d?4\n and there no vertex v2\n located at the distance 2\n from s\n, then s\n is connected with all vertices in its connected component and this component does not contain t\n.\n\nObservation 7. If, under conditions of the previous observation, it we remove vertex s\n, then all the vertices initially adjacent to it will be distributed into several connected components. If all connected components are cliques, there are no valid paths. Indeed, after first transition we get into some clique and then we may only move inside it and it keeps shrinking until we get to an isolated vertex from which we can not go anywhere.\n\nObservation 8. If any of the connected components adjacent with s\n is not a clique, then the shortest valid non-trivial path has a length of 5\n. Indeed, consider a connected component C\n initially connected with s\n that is not a clique. It is not a clique, hence it contains a vertex v1\n of degree less than |C|?1\n. This vertex is not connected with a whole component C\n, thus there are vertices v2,v3?C\n such that v3\n is not connected with v1\n, while v1\n and v2\n are connected and v2\n and v3\n are also connected with an edge. It means that there is a non-trivial path v0?v1?v2?v3?v1?t\n.\n\nThe observations above cover all possible cases in this problem and also yield a solution working in linear time in terms of a size of the original graph."
