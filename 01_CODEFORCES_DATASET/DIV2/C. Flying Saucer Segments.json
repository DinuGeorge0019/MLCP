Flying Saucer Segments", "statement": "An expedition group flew from planet ACM-1 to Earth in order to study\r\nthe bipedal species (its representatives don\u2019t even have antennas on\r\ntheir heads!).The flying saucer, on which the brave pioneers set off,\r\nconsists of three sections. These sections are connected by a chain: the\r\n1-st section is adjacent only to the 2-nd one, the 2-nd one to the 1-st\r\nand the 3-rd ones, the 3-rd one only to the 2-nd one. The transitions\r\nare possible only between the adjacent sections.The spacecraft team\r\nconsists of aliens. Each of them is given a rank an integer from to .\r\nThe ranks of all astronauts are distinct. The rules established on the\r\nSaucer, state that an alien may move from section to section only if it\r\nis senior in rank to all aliens who are in the segments and (besides,\r\nthe segments and are of course required to be adjacent). Any alien\r\nrequires exactly minute to make a move. Besides, safety regulations\r\nrequire that no more than one alien moved at the same minute along the\r\nship.Alien is senior in rank to alien , if the number indicating rank ,\r\nis more than the corresponding number for .At the moment the whole\r\nsaucer team is in the 3-rd segment. They all need to move to the 1-st\r\nsegment. One member of the crew, the alien with the identification\r\nnumber CFR-140, decided to calculate the minimum time (in minutes) they\r\nwill need to perform this task.Help CFR-140, figure out the minimum time\r\n(in minutes) that all the astronauts will need to move from the 3-rd\r\nsegment to the 1-st one.
