    "editorial": "Consider N distinct prime numbers: p1, p2, , pn.\n\nLet A=p1*p2**pn. Then, easy to see, that the numbers A/p1, A/p2, , A/pn can be considered as the answer.\n\nThe special case is when N=2. In this case there is no answer. We can see that this solution needs long arithmetic. If we choose first n prime numbers as p1, p2, , pn then the maximal number in the answer for all N<=50 contains less than 100 digits.\n\n \n\nOf course, there are other solutions. For example, if N=3 numbers 15, 10, 6 are the answer, and for N>3 numbers 15, 10, 6, 6*2, 6*3, , 6*(N-2) are the answer.",
