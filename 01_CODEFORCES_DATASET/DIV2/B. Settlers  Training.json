At the moment the defense structure accommodates exactly\r\nsoldiers. Within this task we can assume that the number of soldiers in\r\nthe defense structure won\u2019t either increase or decrease.Every soldier\r\nhas a rank some natural number from to . stands for a private and stands\r\nfor a general. The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he\r\nfights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the\r\nhighest possible rank.To increase the ranks of soldiers they need to\r\ntrain. But the soldiers won\u2019t train for free, and each training session\r\nrequires one golden coin. On each training session all the soldiers are\r\npresent.At the end of each training session the soldiers\u2019 ranks increase\r\nas follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same\r\nrank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then,\r\nwithin each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank are present,\r\nexactly one soldier increases his rank by one.You know the ranks of all\r\nsoldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are\r\nneeded to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank .\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <map>\n#include <set>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint a[105];\n\nint main (void)\n{\n  int n, k;\n  scanf(\"%d%d\", &n, &k);\n\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++)\n    scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n\n  int turn = 0;\n  while (a[0]<k) {\n    for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {\n      if ((j == n-1 || a[j] != a[j+1]) && a[j] < k) {\n        a[j]++;\n      }\n    }\n    turn++;\n  }\n\n  printf (\"%d\\n\", turn);\n\n\n  return 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
