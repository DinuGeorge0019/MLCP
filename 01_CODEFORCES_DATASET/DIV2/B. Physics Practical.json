    "statement": "One day Vasya was on a physics practical, performing the task on\r\nmeasuring the capacitance. He followed the teacher’s advice and did as\r\nmuch as measurements, and recorded the results in the notebook. After\r\nthat he was about to show the results to the teacher, but he remembered\r\nthat at the last lesson, the teacher had made his friend Petya redo the\r\nexperiment because the largest and the smallest results differed by more\r\nthan two times. Vasya is lazy, and he does not want to redo the\r\nexperiment. He wants to do the task and go home play computer games. So\r\nhe decided to cheat: before Vasya shows the measurements to the teacher,\r\nhe will erase some of them, so as to make the largest and the smallest\r\nresults of the remaining measurements differ in no more than two times.\r\nIn other words, if the remaining measurements have the smallest result ,\r\nand the largest result , then the inequality must fulfill. Of course, to\r\navoid the teacher’s suspicion, Vasya wants to remove as few measurement\r\nresults as possible from his notes.Help Vasya, find what minimum number\r\nof measurement results he will have to erase from his notes so that the\r\nlargest and the smallest of the remaining results of the measurements\r\ndiffered in no more than two times.\r\n",
