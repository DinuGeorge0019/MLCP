    "editorial": "We expected many unproved, but tested solutions. I think that careful prove of my solution with pen and paper is very difficult. So I will use some statistic-based facts.\n\nConsider the set of divisors of number k. One can check that it's beautiful set.\nIf factorisation of k has the form  where ?i???3 and pi is distinct primes, set of divisors of k which is less than  is also beautiful.\nHow to prove item 2? Consider set A of pairs of divisors of k (ai,?bi) such as ai·bi?=?k and ai?<?bi. Obiviously (if k is not complete square) any divisor will be contained only in one pair. It's easy too see that . Consider some element of factorisation of k p? such as  and it is not true that . Let f(x) is maximal number s such as . f(ai)?+?f(bi)?=??. For every q such as  numbers q,?q·p,?...,?q·p? will be divisors of k. That implies that  where d is number of divisors of . So in  pairs both numbers are divisible by p. So set {a0,?...,?a|A|} is beautiful.\nBut there are some pairs with f(ai)?=??.  is equivalent approval.\nIt's always possible to find such k as number of it's divisors is bigger than 2·w where w is number of elements in required set. You may write following dp to find it.\ndp[i][j] is minimal k which is constructed of first i primes ans has j divisors. \nAbout 10 primes is enough to cover all k.\nNow we can construct beautiful sets with more than k elements.\nUsing item 4 we will understand that constructed answer is very beautiful (about 60% of elements divisible by every possible p) and we can always delete extra elements.\nLast items is not strict, but one can check it with his computer.",
