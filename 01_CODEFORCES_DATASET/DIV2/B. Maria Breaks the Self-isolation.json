Maria Breaks the Self-isolation", "statement": "Maria is the most active old lady in her house. She was tired of sitting\r\nat home. She decided to organize a ceremony against the coronavirus.She\r\nhas n friends who are also grannies (Maria is not included in this\r\nnumber). The i-th granny is ready to attend the ceremony, provided that\r\nat the time of her appearance in the courtyard there will be at least\r\na_i other grannies there. Note that grannies can come into the courtyard\r\nat the same time. Formally, the granny i agrees to come if the number of\r\nother grannies who came earlier or at the same time with her is greater\r\nthan or equal to a_i.Grannies gather in the courtyard like that.\r\nInitially, only Maria is in the courtyard (that is, the initial number\r\nof grannies in the courtyard is 1). All the remaining n grannies are\r\nstill sitting at home. On each step Maria selects a subset of grannies,\r\nnone of whom have yet to enter the courtyard. She promises each of them\r\nthat at the time of her appearance there will be at least a_i other\r\ngrannies (including Maria) in the courtyard. Maria can call several\r\ngrannies at once. In this case, the selected grannies will go out into\r\nthe courtyard . She cannot deceive grannies, that is, the situation when\r\nthe i-th granny in the moment of appearing in the courtyard, finds that\r\nnow there are strictly less than a_i other grannies (except herself, but\r\nincluding Maria), is prohibited. Please note that if several grannies\r\nappeared in the yard at the same time, then each of them sees others at\r\nthe time of appearance. Your task is to find what maximum number of\r\ngrannies (including herself) Maria can collect in the courtyard for the\r\nceremony. After all, the more people in one place during quarantine, the\r\nmore effective the ceremony!Consider an example: if n=6 and\r\na=[1,5,4,5,1,9], then: at the first step Maria can call grannies with\r\nnumbers 1 and 5, each of them will see two grannies at the moment of\r\ngoing out into the yard (note that a_1=1\r\nle 2 and a_5=1\r\nle 2); at the second step, Maria can call grannies with numbers 2, 3 and\r\n4, each of them will see five grannies at the moment of going out into\r\nthe yard (note that a_2=5\r\nle 5, a_3=4\r\nle 5 and a_4=5\r\nle 5); the 6-th granny cannot be called into the yard therefore, the\r\nanswer is 6 (Maria herself and another 5 grannies).\r\n", "solutions": ["// Author : PinkRabbit\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n#define F(i,a,b) for(int i=a;i<=(b);++i)\n#define F2(i,a,b) for(int i=a;i<(b);++i)\n#define dF(i,a,b) for(int i=a;i>=(b);--i)\n#define debug(...) fprintf(stderr,__VA_ARGS__)\n#define Debug debug(\"Passing [%s] in LINE %d\\n\",__FUNCTION__,__LINE__)\n#define MN 300005\n#define MM 600005\n#define ll long long\n#define mod 998244353\n#define inf 0x3f3f3f3f\n#define infll 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f\ntypedef pair<int,int> pii;\n#define pb push_back\n#define mkp make_pair\n#define fi first\n#define se second\ninline int qpow(int b,ll e,int m=mod){int a=1;for(;e;e>>=1,b=(ll)b*b%m)if(e&1)a=(ll)a*b%m;return a;}\nint n,m,q,k;\nint a[MN],b[MN],f[MN],g[MN];\nvector<int>G[MN];\nint h[MN],nxt[MM],to[MM],tot;\ninline void ins(int x,int y){nxt[++tot]=h[x];to[tot]=y;h[x]=tot;}\nint main(){int tests=1;scanf(\"%d\",&tests);\nwhile(tests--){\n\tscanf(\"%d\",&n);\n\tF(i,1,n)scanf(\"%d\",a+i);\n\tsort(a+1,a+n+1);\n\tint p=0;\n\tF(i,1,n)if(a[i]<=i)p=i;\n\tprintf(\"%d\\n\",p+1);\n}\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy", "sortings"], "dificulty": "1000", "interactive": false}
