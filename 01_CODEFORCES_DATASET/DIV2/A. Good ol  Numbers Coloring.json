    "statement": "Consider the set of all nonnegative integers: {0, 1, 2,\r\ndots}. Given two integers a and b (1\r\nle a, b\r\nle 10^4). We paint all the numbers in increasing number first we paint\r\n0, then we paint 1, then 2 and so on.Each number is painted white or\r\nblack. We paint a number i according to the following rules: if i = 0,\r\nit is colored white; if i\r\nge a and i - a is colored white, i is also colored white; if i\r\nge b and i - b is colored white, i is also colored white; if i is still\r\nnot colored white, it is colored black. In this way, each nonnegative\r\ninteger gets one of two colors.For example, if a=3, b=5, then the colors\r\nof the numbers (in the order from 0) are: white (0), black (1), black\r\n(2), white (3), black (4), white (5), white (6), black (7), white (8),\r\nwhite (9), ...Note that: It is possible that there are infinitely many\r\nnonnegative integers colored black. For example, if a = 10 and b = 10,\r\nthen only 0, 10, 20, 30 and any other nonnegative integers that end in 0\r\nwhen written in base 10 are white. The other integers are colored black.\r\nIt is also possible that there are only finitely many nonnegative\r\nintegers colored black. For example, when a = 1 and b = 10, then there\r\nis no nonnegative integer colored black at all. Your task is to\r\ndetermine whether or not the number of nonnegative integers colored is\r\ninfinite.If there are infinitely many nonnegative integers colored\r\nblack, simply print a line containing \"\" (without the quotes).\r\nOtherwise, print \"\" (without the quotes).\r\n",

    "editorial": "If , print \"Infinite\". This is correct because any integer that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\r\ndivisible by will not be expressible in the form since is always\r\ndivisible by . Otherwise, print \"Finite\". To show that this is correct,\r\nwe will prove that any integer greater than is colored white. Let be an\r\ninteger greater than . Consider the set . If, for any , is divisible by\r\n, we are done. Otherwise, by the pigeonhole principle, there exists\r\ndistinct such that they have the same remainder when divided by , thus\r\ndivides . WLOG, let .
