Points not necessary were given in the\r\norder of clockwise or counterclockwise traversal.Alex had very nice test\r\nfor this problem, but is somehow happened that the last line of the\r\ninput was lost and now he has only three out of four points of the\r\noriginal parallelogram. He remembers that test was so good that he asks\r\nyou to restore it given only these three points.\r\n",
