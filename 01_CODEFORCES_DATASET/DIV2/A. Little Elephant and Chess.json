    "statement": "The Little Elephant loves chess very much. One day the Little Elephant\r\nand his friend decided to play chess. They’ve got the chess pieces but\r\nthe board is a problem. They’ve got an checkered board, each square is\r\npainted either black or white. The Little Elephant and his friend know\r\nthat a doesn’t have any side-adjacent cells with the same color and the\r\nupper left cell is white. To play chess, they want to make the board\r\nthey have a proper chessboard. For that the friends can choose any row\r\nof the board and cyclically shift the cells of the chosen row, that is,\r\nput the last (rightmost) square on the first place in the row and shift\r\nthe others one position to the right. You can run the described\r\noperation (or not run it at all).For example, if the first line of the\r\nboard looks like that \"\" (the white cells of the line are marked with\r\ncharacter \"\", the black cells are marked with character \"\"), then after\r\none cyclic shift it will look like that \"\".Help the Little Elephant and\r\nhis friend to find out whether they can use any number of the described\r\noperations to turn the board they have into a proper chessboard.\r\n",
