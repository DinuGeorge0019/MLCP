Games", "statement": "Manao works on a sports TV. He\u2019s spent much time watching the football\r\ngames of some country. After a while he began to notice different\r\npatterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform\r\nand guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on\r\nthe home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else\u2019s\r\nstadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to\r\nthat rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the\r\nguests\u2019 uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For\r\neach team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.There are\r\nteams taking part in the national championship. The championship\r\nconsists of games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At\r\nthis point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a\r\nhost team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the\r\ngames does not affect this number.You know the colors of the home and\r\nguest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by\r\nintegers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number.\r\nHelp Manao find the answer to his question.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <vector> \n#include <list> \n#include <map> \n#include <set> \n#include <deque> \n#include <queue> \n#include <stack> \n#include <bitset> \n#include <algorithm> \n#include <functional> \n#include <numeric> \n#include <utility> \n#include <sstream> \n#include <iostream> \n#include <iomanip> \n#include <cstdio> \n#include <cmath> \n#include <cstdlib> \n#include <cctype> \n#include <string> \n#include <cstring> \n#include <ctime> \n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define _int64 long long\n\nint a[100][2];\n\nint main()\n{\n  int i,j,n,cnt;\n  scanf(\"%d\",&n);\n  for (i=0;i<n;i++)\n    scanf(\"%d%d\",&a[i][0],&a[i][1]);\n  cnt=0;\n  for (i=0;i<n;i++)\n    for (j=0;j<n;j++)\n      if (i!=j)\n        if (a[i][0]==a[j][1]) cnt++;\n  printf(\"%d\\n\",cnt);\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force"], "dificulty": "800", "interactive": false}
