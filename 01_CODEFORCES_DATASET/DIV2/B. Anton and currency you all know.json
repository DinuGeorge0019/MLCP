The exchange rate of against the burle has increased so\r\nmuch that to simplify the calculations, its fractional part was\r\nneglected and the exchange rate is now assumed to be an integer.Reliable\r\nsources have informed the financier Anton of some information about the\r\nexchange rate of against the burle for tomorrow. Now Anton knows that\r\ntomorrow the exchange rate will be an even number, which can be obtained\r\nfrom the present rate by swapping exactly two distinct digits in it. Of\r\nall the possible values that meet these conditions, the exchange rate\r\nfor tomorrow will be the maximum possible. It is guaranteed that today\r\nthe exchange rate is an positive integer . Help Anton to determine the\r\nexchange rate of for tomorrow!\r\n",
