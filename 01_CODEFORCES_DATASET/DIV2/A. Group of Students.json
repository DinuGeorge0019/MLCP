Now you need to set the passing rate (integer from\r\n1 to ): all schoolchildren who got less than points go to the beginner\r\ngroup and those who get at strictly least points go to the intermediate\r\ngroup. We know that if the size of a group is more than , then the\r\nuniversity won\u2019t find a room for them. We also know that if a group has\r\nless than schoolchildren, then it is too small and there\u2019s no point in\r\nhaving classes with it. So, you need to split all schoolchildren into\r\ntwo groups so that the size of each group was from to , inclusive.
