And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at\r\nhis place and invited his friends there.If there\u2019s one thing Petya likes\r\nmore that receiving gifts, that\u2019s watching others giving gifts to\r\nsomebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year\r\nand made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does\r\nnot participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with\r\nintegers from to . Petya remembered that a friend number gave a gift to\r\na friend number . He also remembered that each of his friends received\r\nexactly one gift.Now Petya wants to know for each friend the number of a\r\nfriend who has given him a gift.\r\n", "solutions": ["//Done by Grey Matter\n//Fet per Ferran Alet\n\n#include<iostream>\n#include<cmath>\n#include<iomanip>\n#include<vector>\n#include<map>\n#include<queue>\n#include<fstream>\n#include<algorithm>\n#include<string>\n#include<stack>\n#include<numeric>\n#include<set>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<list>\n\n#define INF 2147483647\n#define LINF 1000000000000000000LL\n#define EPS 1e-9\n#define debug(x) cerr << #x << \" = \" << x << endl\n#define FOR(x,y) for(int x=0;x<y;x++)\n#define FORU(x,y) for(int x=1;x<=y;x++)\nusing namespace std;\n\n\ntypedef long long ll;\ntypedef pair<int,int> PII;\ntypedef vector<int> VI;\ntypedef vector<VI> VVI;\ntypedef vector<bool> VB;\ntypedef vector<VB> VVB;\ntypedef vector<string> VS;\ntypedef map<int,int> MII;\ntypedef MII::iterator iMII;\n\nint main(){\n//ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    int n;\n    cin>>n;\n    VI v(n);\n    int a;\n    FOR(i,n){\n        cin>>a;\n        v[a-1]=i+1;\n    }\n    FOR(i,n) {\n        if(i) cout<<' ';\n        cout<<v[i];\n    }\n    cout<<endl;\n   // system(\"pause\");\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "800", "interactive": false}
