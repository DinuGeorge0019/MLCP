    "statement": "George decided to prepare a Codesecrof round, so he has prepared\r\nproblems for the round. Let’s number the problems with integers through\r\n. George estimates the -th problem’s complexity by integer .To make the\r\nround , he needs to put at least problems there. Besides, he needs to\r\nhave at least one problem with complexity exactly , at least one with\r\ncomplexity exactly , ..., and at least one with complexity exactly . Of\r\ncourse, the round can also have problems with other complexities.George\r\nhas a poor imagination. It’s easier for him to make some already\r\nprepared problem simpler than to come up with a new one and prepare it.\r\nGeorge is magnificent at simplifying problems. He can simplify any\r\nalready prepared problem with complexity to any positive integer\r\ncomplexity (), by changing limits on the input data.However, nothing is\r\nso simple. George understood that even if he simplifies some problems,\r\nhe can run out of problems for a round. That’s why he decided to find\r\nout the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in addition\r\nto the he’s prepared in order to make a good round. Note that George can\r\ncome up with a new problem of any complexity.\r\n",
