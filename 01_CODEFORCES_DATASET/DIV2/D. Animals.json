Animals", "statement": "Once upon a time DravDe, an outstanding person famous for his\r\nprofessional achievements (as you must remember, he works in a warehouse\r\nstoring Ogudar-Olok, a magical but non-alcoholic drink) came home after\r\na hard day. That day he had to drink 9875 boxes of the drink and, having\r\ncome home, he went to bed at once.DravDe dreamt about managing a\r\nsuccessful farm. He dreamt that every day one animal came to him and\r\nasked him to let it settle there. However, DravDe, being unimaginably\r\nkind, could send the animal away and it went, rejected. There were\r\nexactly days in DravDe s dream and the animal that came on the -th day,\r\nate exactly tons of food daily starting from day . But if one day the\r\nanimal could not get the food it needed, it got really sad. At the very\r\nbeginning of the dream there were exactly tons of food on the\r\nfarm.DravDe woke up terrified...When he retold the dream to you, he\r\ncouldn t remember how many animals were on the farm by the end of the\r\n-th day any more, but he did remember that nobody got sad (as it was a\r\nhappy farm) and that there was the maximum possible amount of the\r\nanimals. That s the number he wants you to find out. It should be\r\nnoticed that the animals arrived in the morning and DravDe only started\r\nto feed them in the afternoon, so that if an animal willing to join them\r\nis rejected, it can t eat any farm food. But if the animal does join the\r\nfarm, it eats daily from that day to the -th.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cstdio>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <map>\n#include <set>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <string>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <queue>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint n, X;\nint c[100];\n\nint dp[100][10001];\n\nint process(int i, int food){\n    if (i == n) return 0;\n    if (dp[i][food] != -1)\n        return dp[i][food];\n    int ans=0, v;\n    ans = process(i+1, food);\n    if ((n-i)*c[i] <= food) {\n        v = 1 + process(i+1, food - (n-i)*c[i]);\n        ans = max(ans, v);\n    }\n    dp[i][food] = ans;\n    return ans;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    freopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n    freopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));\n    scanf(\"%d%d\", &n, &X);\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)\n        scanf(\"%d\", &c[i]);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", process(0, X));\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["dp", "greedy"], "dificulty": "1700", "interactive": false}
