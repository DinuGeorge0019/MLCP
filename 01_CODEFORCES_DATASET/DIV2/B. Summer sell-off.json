    "statement": "Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting\r\ngrandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer\r\nNoora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a\r\nshop as an assistant.Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the\r\nfollowing days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in -th\r\nday products will be put up for sale and exactly clients will come to\r\nthe shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes\r\nto the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren\u2019t any left,\r\nleaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short\r\nshelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if\r\nsome part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day,\r\nthat products aren\u2019t kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.For\r\nadvertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He\r\nasked Noora to choose any days from next for sell-outs. On each of\r\nchosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be\r\ndoubled. Thus, if on -th day shop planned to put up for sale products\r\nand Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would\r\nkeep products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times\r\nmore products on days of sell-out.Noora\u2019s task is to choose days to\r\nmaximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with\r\nsuch a difficult problem.\r\n",
