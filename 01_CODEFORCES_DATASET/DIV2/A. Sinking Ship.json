All crew members have already lined up in a row (for\r\nconvenience let\u2019s label them all from left to right with positive\r\nintegers from 1 to ) and await further instructions. However, one should\r\nevacuate the crew properly, in a strict order. Specifically:The first\r\ncrew members to leave the ship are rats. Then women and children (both\r\ngroups have the same priority) leave the ship. After that all men are\r\nevacuated from the ship. The captain leaves the sinking ship last.If we\r\ncannot determine exactly who should leave the ship first for any two\r\nmembers of the crew by the rules from the previous paragraph, then the\r\none who stands to the left in the line leaves the ship first (or in\r\nother words, the one whose number in the line is less).For each crew\r\nmember we know his status as a crew member, and also his name. All crew\r\nmembers have different names. Determine the order in which to evacuate\r\nthe crew.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <map>\n#include <set>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nmap <string, int> r;\n\nchar s[105], t[105];\n\nvector <pair <int, string> > v;\n\nint main (void)\n{\n  r[\"rat\"] = 1, r[\"woman\"] = 2, r[\"child\"] = 2, r[\"man\"]=3, r[\"captain\"]=4;\n\n  int n;\n  scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%s%s\", s, t);\n    v.push_back(make_pair(r[t] * 10000 + i, s));\n  }\n\n  sort(v.begin(), v.end());\n\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++)\n    puts(v[i].second.c_str());\n\n  return 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation", "sortings", "strings"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
