Thus Leha was left\r\ncompletely alone in a quiet town Vi kopolis. He almost even fell into a\r\ndepression from boredom!Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a\r\nlittle. He chooses two integers and and then calculates the greatest\r\ncommon divisor of integers \" factorial\" and \" factorial\". Formally the\r\nhacker wants to find out GCD. It\u2019s well known that the factorial of an\r\ninteger is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to .\r\nThus . For example . Recall that GCD is the largest positive integer\r\nthat divides (without a remainder) both and .Leha has learned how to\r\nsolve this task very effective.
