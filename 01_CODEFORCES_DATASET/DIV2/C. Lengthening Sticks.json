    "editorial": "Let's count the number of ways to form a triple which can't represent triangle sides, and then we subtract this value from  \u0097 the total number of ways to increase the sticks not more than l in total. This number is obtained from partition of l into 4 summands (la?+?lb?+?lc?+?unusedl?=?l), or can be counted using a for loop.\n\nNow we consider triples a?+?la,?b?+?lb,?c?+?lc, where la?+?lb?+?lc???l,?la,?lb,?lc???0. Fix the maximal side, for example it would be a?+?la. We'll have to do the following algo for b?+?lb and c?+?lc in the same way. The triple is not a triangle with maximal side a?+?la if a?+?la???b?+?lb?+?c?+?lc. If we iterate over la between 0 and l, we have the following conditions on lb,?lc:\n\nlb?+?lc???a?-?b?-?c?+?la,?\nlb?+?lc???l?-?la,?\nlb,?lc???0. So, non-negative integers lb,?lc should be such that lb?+?lc???min(a?-?b?-?c?+?la,?l?-?la). If we denote this minimum as x than we can choose lb,?lc in  different ways (again we divide x into three summands: lb,?lc and some unused volume). Also when we fix lb, there are x?-?lb?+?1 ways to choose lc, so the overall number of pair lb,?lc is\n\n\nso we obtain the same formula.\n\nTo sum up, we need to iterate over the maximal side and over the addition to that side, then write these formulas, and subtract the result from the total number of different additions to the sides. The complexity of the solution is O(l)."
