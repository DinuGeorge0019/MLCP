Save the problem ", "statement": "Attention: we lost all the test cases for this problem, so instead of\r\nsolving the problem, we need you to generate test cases. We\u2019re going to\r\ngive you the answer, and you need to print a test case that produces the\r\ngiven answer. The original problem is in the following paragraph.People\r\ndon\u2019t use cash as often as they used to. Having a credit card solves\r\nsome of the hassles of cash, such as having to receive change when you\r\ncan\u2019t form the exact amount of money needed to purchase an item.\r\nTypically cashiers will give you as few coins as possible in change, but\r\nthey don\u2019t have to. For example, if your change is 30 cents, a cashier\r\ncould give you a 5 cent piece and a 25 cent piece, or they could give\r\nyou three 10 cent pieces, or ten 1 cent pieces, two 5 cent pieces, and\r\none 10 cent piece. Altogether there are 18 different ways to make 30\r\ncents using only 1 cent pieces, 5 cent pieces, 10 cent pieces, and 25\r\ncent pieces. Two ways are considered different if they contain a\r\ndifferent number of at least one type of coin. Given the denominations\r\nof the coins and an amount of change to be made, how many different ways\r\nare there to make change?As we mentioned before, we lost all the test\r\ncases for this problem, so we\u2019re actually going to give you the number\r\nof ways, and want you to produce a test case for which the number of\r\nways is the given number. There could be many ways to achieve this (we\r\nguarantee there\u2019s always at least one), so you can print any, as long as\r\nit meets the constraints described below.\r\n", "solutions": ["#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS\n#include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <vector>\n#include <queue>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <map>\n#include <set>\n#include <utility>\n#include <stack>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <bitset>\n#include <deque>\n#include <string>\n#include <list>\n#include <cstdlib>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;\nconst int maxn = 100000 + 100;\ntypedef long long ll;\ntypedef long double ld;\nint a, n, m;\nint main()\n{\n\twhile (cin >> a)\n\t{\n\t\tif (a == 1)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tcout << \"1 1\" << endl;\n\t\t\tcout << 1 << endl;\n\t\t}\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tcout << (a-1) * 2 << \" \" << 2 << endl;\n\t\t\tcout << \"1 2\" << endl;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "constructive algorithms", "math"], "dificulty": "1400", "interactive": false}
