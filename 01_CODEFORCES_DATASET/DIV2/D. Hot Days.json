Hot Days", "statement": "The official capital and the cultural capital of Berland are connected\r\nby a single road running through regions. Each region has a unique\r\nclimate, so the -th region has a stable temperature of degrees in\r\nsummer.This summer a group of schoolchildren wants to get from the\r\nofficial capital to the cultural capital to visit museums and sights.\r\nThe trip organizers transport the children between the cities in buses,\r\nbut sometimes it is very hot. Specifically, if the bus is driving\r\nthrough the -th region and has schoolchildren, then the temperature\r\ninside the bus is degrees.Of course, nobody likes it when the bus is\r\nhot. So, when the bus drives through the -th region, if it has more than\r\ndegrees inside, each of the schoolchild in the bus demands compensation\r\nfor the uncomfortable conditions. The compensation is as large as rubles\r\nand it is charged in each region where the temperature in the bus\r\nexceeds the limit.To save money, the organizers of the trip may\r\narbitrarily add or remove extra buses in the beginning of the trip, and\r\nbetween regions (of course, they need at least one bus to pass any\r\nregion). The organizers can also arbitrarily sort the children into\r\nbuses, however, each of buses in the -th region will cost the organizers\r\nrubles. Please note that sorting children into buses takes no money.Your\r\ntask is to find the minimum number of rubles, which the organizers will\r\nhave to spend to transport all schoolchildren.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<cstdio>\n#include<cstring>\n#include<algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\nlong long n,m;\nint main()\n{\n    scanf(\"%I64d %I64d\",&n,&m);\n    long long ans=0;\n    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\n    {\n        long long t1,t2,x,c;\n        scanf(\"%I64d %I64d %I64d %I64d\",&t1,&t2,&x,&c);\n        long long p=t2-t1;\n        if(p<=0)\n        ans+=m*x+c;\n        else\n        {\n            long long th=(m+p-1)/p;\n            long long gao=th*c;\n            ans+=min(m*x+c,gao);\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%I64d\\n\",ans);\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy"], "dificulty": "1900", "interactive": false}
