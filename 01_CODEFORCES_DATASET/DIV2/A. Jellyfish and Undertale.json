When the\r\ntimer reaches 0, the bomb will explode! To give the residents of Snowdin\r\nenough time to evacuate, you will need to delay the bomb from exploding\r\nfor as long as possible.You have n tools. Each tool can only be used\r\nonce. If you use the i-th tool, the timer will increase by x_i. However,\r\nif the timer is changed to an integer larger than a, the timer will be\r\nset to a due to a bug.More specifically, the following events will\r\nhappen every second in the following order: You will choose some\r\n(possibly none) of your tools that have not been used before. If you\r\nchoose the i-th tool, and the bomb\u2019s timer is currently set to c, the\r\ntimer will be changed to\r\nmin(c + x_i, a). The timer decreases by 1. If the timer reaches 0, the\r\nbomb explodes. Jellyfish now wants to know the maximum time in seconds\r\nuntil the bomb explodes if the tools are used optimally.\r\n",
