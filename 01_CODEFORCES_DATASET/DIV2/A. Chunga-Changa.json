    "statement": "Soon after the Chunga-Changa island was discovered, it started to\r\nacquire some forms of civilization and even market economy. A new\r\ncurrency arose, colloquially called \"chizhik\". One has to pay in\r\nchizhiks to buy a coconut now.Sasha and Masha are about to buy some\r\ncoconuts which are sold at price z chizhiks per coconut. Sasha has x\r\nchizhiks, Masha has y chizhiks. Each girl will buy as many coconuts as\r\nshe can using only her money. This way each girl will buy an integer\r\nnon-negative number of coconuts.The girls discussed their plans and\r\nfound that the total number of coconuts they buy can increase (or\r\ndecrease) if one of them gives several chizhiks to the other girl. The\r\nchizhiks can\u2019t be split in parts, so the girls can only exchange with\r\ninteger number of chizhiks.Consider the following example. Suppose Sasha\r\nhas 5 chizhiks, Masha has 4 chizhiks, and the price for one coconut be 3\r\nchizhiks. If the girls don\u2019t exchange with chizhiks, they will buy 1 + 1\r\n= 2 coconuts. However, if, for example, Masha gives Sasha one chizhik,\r\nthen Sasha will have 6 chizhiks, Masha will have 3 chizhiks, and the\r\ngirls will buy 2 + 1 = 3 coconuts. It is not that easy to live on the\r\nisland now, so Sasha and Mash want to exchange with chizhiks in such a\r\nway that they will buy the maximum possible number of coconuts. Nobody\r\nwants to have a debt, so among all possible ways to buy the maximum\r\npossible number of coconuts find such a way that minimizes the number of\r\nchizhiks one girl gives to the other (it is not important who will be\r\nthe person giving the chizhiks).\r\n",

    "editorial": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to calculate how much coconuts we will buy: (suppose that all\r\nmoney transferred to a single person, this way the number of bought\r\ncoconuts would be clearly maximal) If , then the answer is . The\r\nremaining case is a bit harder. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice, that there is no need to\r\ntransfer chizhiks, since the one transferring money could have used\r\nchizhiks to buy one more coconut herself. Also it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s optimal to transfer\r\ncoins such that the remainder modulo of the receiving part will turn to\r\nbe exactly zero (we could have simply transfer less for the same\r\neffect). So the answer is .\r\n"
