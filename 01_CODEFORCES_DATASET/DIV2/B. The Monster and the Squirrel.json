    "statement": "Ari the monster always wakes up very early with the first ray of the sun\r\nand the first thing she does is feeding her squirrel.Ari draws a regular\r\nconvex polygon on the floor and numbers it\u2019s vertices in clockwise\r\norder. Then starting from the vertex she draws a ray in the direction of\r\neach other vertex. The ray stops when it reaches a vertex or intersects\r\nwith another ray drawn before. Ari repeats this process for vertex (in\r\nthis particular order). And then she puts a walnut in each region inside\r\nthe polygon. Ada the squirrel wants to collect all the walnuts, but she\r\nis not allowed to step on the lines drawn by Ari. That means Ada have to\r\nperform a small jump if she wants to go from one region to another. Ada\r\ncan jump from one region P to another region Q if and only if P and Q\r\n.Assuming that Ada starts from outside of the picture, what is the\r\nminimum number of jumps she has to perform in order to collect all the\r\nwalnuts?\r\n",

    "editorial": "After drawing the rays from the first vertex (n?-?2) triangles are formed. The subsequent rays will generate independently sub-regions in these triangles. Let's analyse the triangle determined by vertices 1,?i,?i?+?1, after drawing the rays from vertex i and (i?+?1) the triangle will be divided into (n?-?i)?+?(i?-?2)?=?n?-?2 regions. Therefore the total number of convex regions is (n?-?2)2\n\n \n\nIf the squirrel starts from the region that have 1 as a vertex, then she can go through each region of triangle (1,?i,?i?+?1) once. That implies that the squirrel can collect all the walnuts in (n?-?2)2 jumps."
