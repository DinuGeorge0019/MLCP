Students  Revenge", "statement": "A student\u2019s life is fraught with complications. Some Berland University\r\nstudents know this only too well. Having studied for two years, they\r\ncontracted strong antipathy towards the chairperson of some department.\r\nIndeed, the person in question wasn\u2019t the kindest of ladies to begin\r\nwith: prone to reforming groups, banning automatic passes and other mean\r\ndeeds. At last the students decided that she just can\u2019t get away with\r\nall this anymore...The students pulled some strings on the higher levels\r\nand learned that the next University directors\u2019 meeting is going to\r\ndiscuss orders about the chairperson and accept exactly of them. There\r\nare two values assigned to each order: is the number of the\r\nchairperson\u2019s hairs that turn grey if she obeys the order and the\r\ndispleasement of the directors if the order isn\u2019t obeyed. The students\r\nmay make the directors pass any orders chosen by them. The students know\r\nthat the chairperson will obey exactly out of these orders. She will\r\npick the orders to obey in the way that minimizes first, the directors\u2019\r\ndispleasement and second, the number of hairs on her head that turn\r\ngrey.The students want to choose orders in the way that maximizes the\r\nnumber of hairs on the chairperson\u2019s head that turn grey. If there are\r\nmultiple ways to accept the orders, then the students are keen on\r\nmaximizing the directors\u2019 displeasement with the chairperson\u2019s actions.\r\nHelp them.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <cassert>\n\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long ll;\nconst int Maxn = 1e5 + 10;\nint n, p, k;\nstruct Ord\n{\n    int a, b;\n    int id;\n}ord[Maxn];\nint id[Maxn];\nbool cmp1(const Ord &x, const Ord &y)\n{\n    if (x.b == y.b) return  x.a < y.a;\n    return x.b > y.b;\n}\n\nbool cmp2(int x, int y)\n{\n    if (ord[x].a == ord[y].a) return ord[x].b > ord[y].b;\n    return ord[x].a > ord[y].a;\n}\nvoid out()\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n        cout << ord[i].a <<\" \" << ord[i].b << endl;\n}\nint main()\n{\n    while (scanf(\"%d%d%d\", &n, &p, &k) != EOF)\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n        {\n            scanf(\"%d%d\", &ord[i].a, &ord[i].b);\n            ord[i].id = i + 1;\n            id[i] = i;\n        }\n        sort(ord, ord + n, cmp1);\n        //out();\n        sort(id, id + n - p + k, cmp2);\n        \n        int maxid = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)\n        {\n            printf(\"%d \", ord[id[i]].id);\n            maxid = max(maxid, id[i]);\n        }\n        for (int i = 1; i <= p - k; ++i)\n            printf(\"%d \", ord[maxid + i].id);\n        \n        puts(\"\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["data structures", "greedy", "sortings"], "dificulty": "2200", "interactive": false}
