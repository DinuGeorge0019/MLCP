    "statement": "Those days, many boys use beautiful girls\u2019 photos as avatars in forums.\r\nSo it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance.\r\nLast year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty\r\n(he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they\r\nbecame a couple in the network. But yesterday, he came to see \"her\" in\r\nthe real world and found out \"she\" is actually a very strong man! Our\r\nhero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up\r\nwith a way to recognize users\u2019 genders by their user names.This is his\r\nmethod: if the number of distinct characters in one\u2019s user name is odd,\r\nthen he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string\r\nthat denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender\r\nof this user by his method.\r\n",
