    "statement": "Vector Willman and Array Bolt are the two most famous athletes of\r\nByteforces. They are going to compete in a race with a distance of\r\nmeters today. Willman and Bolt have exactly the same speed, so when they\r\ncompete the result is always a tie. That is a problem for the organizers\r\nbecause they want a winner. While watching previous races the organizers\r\nhave noticed that Willman can perform steps of length equal to meters,\r\nand Bolt can perform steps of length equal to meters. Organizers decided\r\nto slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the\r\nracetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the\r\nathlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the\r\nracetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes).\r\nNote that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will\r\nat some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further\r\nwill cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete fall\r\ninto the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or\r\nequal to the chosen distance .Since the organizers are very fair, the\r\nare going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen\r\nrandomly and uniformly in range from 1 to (both are included). What is\r\nthe probability that Willman and Bolt tie again today?\r\n",
