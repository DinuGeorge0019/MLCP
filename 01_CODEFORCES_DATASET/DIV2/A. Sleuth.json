He can\r\nask any questions whatsoever that can be answered with \"Yes\" or \"No\".\r\nAll the rest agree beforehand to answer the questions like that: if the\r\nquestion s last letter is a vowel, they answer \"Yes\" and if the last\r\nletter is a consonant, they answer \"No\". Of course, the sleuth knows\r\nnothing about it and his task is to understand that.Unfortunately, Vasya\r\nis not very smart.
