Capture Valerian", "statement": "It\u2019s now AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia.\r\nHe is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and\r\nAniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to\r\noccupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now\r\ntheir senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is\r\nnow going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the\r\ncowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To\r\ncapture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too\r\nscared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has parts. The\r\nfirst part is an integer number . The second part is either an integer\r\nnumber or some really odd sign which looks like . The third one is an\r\ninteger and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing\r\nsomething. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors,\r\nShapur found out the secret behind the locks. is an integer written in\r\nbase , to open the door we should write it in base . The only bad news\r\nis that this is some sort of special numbering system that is used only\r\nin Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here\u2019s\r\nan explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn\u2019t have\r\nzero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified\r\nwith the letter ) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter )\r\nfor a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter ) for a ten, a\r\n(identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: = = = = =\r\n= =Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (, , , )\r\nvalues, with , , substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration\r\ncontinuing: , , , , , , etc., and the same for other bases: , , , , ; ,\r\n, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must\r\nbe employed, with the base placed before the higher base: , , , , ,\r\n.Also in bases greater than we use for , for , etc.Help Shapur capture\r\nValerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\r\n", "solutions": ["# include <cstdio>\n\nchar conv[]=\"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\";\n\nvoid printroman(long long N)\n{\n    while(N>=1000)\n    {\n        printf(\"M\");\n        N-=1000;\n    }\n    while(N>=900)\n    {\n        printf(\"CM\");\n        N-=900;\n    }\n    while(N>=500)\n    {\n        printf(\"D\");\n        N-=500;\n    }\n    while(N>=400)\n    {\n        printf(\"CD\");\n        N-=400;\n    }\n    while(N>=100)\n    {\n        printf(\"C\");\n        N-=100;\n    }\n    while(N>=90)\n    {\n        printf(\"XC\");\n        N-=90;\n    }\n    while(N>=50)\n    {\n        printf(\"L\");\n        N-=50;\n    }\n    while(N>=40)\n    {\n        printf(\"XL\");\n        N-=40;\n    }\n    while(N>=10)\n    {\n        printf(\"X\");\n        N-=10;\n    }\n    while(N>=9)\n    {\n        printf(\"IX\");\n        N-=9;\n    }\n    while(N>=5)\n    {\n        printf(\"V\");\n        N-=5;\n    }\n    while(N>=4)\n    {\n        printf(\"IV\");\n        N-=4;\n    }\n    while(N>=1)\n    {\n        printf(\"I\");\n        N-=1;\n    }\n}\n\nlong long toint(char *inp,int base)\n{\n    long long ret=0ll;\n    for(int i=0;inp[i];i++)\n        ret=ret*base+(inp[i]<'A'?inp[i]-'0':inp[i]-'A'+10);\n    return ret;\n}\n\nvoid printbase(long long N,int base)\n{\n    if(N>=base)printbase(N/base,base);\n    printf(\"%c\",conv[N%base]);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    int A;\n    scanf(\"%d\",&A);\n    \n    char B[3];\n    scanf(\"%s\",B);\n    \n    int b;\n    if(B[0]!='R')sscanf(B,\"%d\",&b);\n    \n    char C[1001];\n    scanf(\"%s\",C);\n    \n    long long I=toint(C,A);\n\n    if(B[0]=='R')\n        printroman(I);\n    else\n        printbase(I,b);\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math"], "dificulty": "2000", "interactive": false}
