    "statement": "One day Vasya heard a story: \"In the city of High Bertown a bus number\r\n62 left from the bus station. It had grown-ups and kids...\"The latter\r\nevents happen to be of no importance to us. Vasya is an accountant and\r\nhe loves counting money. So he wondered what maximum and minimum sum of\r\nmoney these passengers could have paid for the ride.The bus fare equals\r\none berland ruble in High Bertown. However, not everything is that easy\r\nchild can ride for free with each grown-up passenger. That means that a\r\ngrown-up passenger who rides with his children, pays overall rubles: a\r\nticket for himself and tickets for his children. Also, a grown-up can\r\nride without children, in this case he only pays one ruble.We know that\r\nin High Bertown children can\u2019t ride in a bus unaccompanied by\r\ngrown-ups.Help Vasya count the minimum and the maximum sum in Berland\r\nrubles, that all passengers of this bus could have paid in total.\r\n",
