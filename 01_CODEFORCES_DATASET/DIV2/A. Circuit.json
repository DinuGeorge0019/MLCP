    "editorial": "Observe that an even number of switch toggles on the same light will not\r\nchange that light\u00e2\u0080\u0099s status. In other words, a light is on if and only if\r\nexactly one of the two switches connecting to it is on.Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denote and\r\nas the number of off switches and on switches in the circuit. We see\r\nthat The maximum number of on lights is : we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t achieve more than\r\nthis amount since any on light decreases both and by , and we can\r\nachieve this amount by matching pairs of one off switch and one on\r\nswitch, and the rest can be matched arbitrarily. The minimum number of\r\non lights is . Since , they have the same parity. Then, we can easily\r\nsee that when both and are even, we can match pairs of the same type of\r\nswitches, so there are no on lights in this case. When both and are odd,\r\nwe must match one on switch with one off switch to make and even, so\r\nthere is one on light in this case. The calculation of and can be easily\r\ndone by a simple iteration over the switches.Time complexity: .\r\n",

    "statement": "Alice has just crafted a circuit with n lights and 2n switches. Each\r\ncomponent (a light or a switch) has two states: on or off. The lights\r\nand switches are arranged in a way that: Each light is connected to\r\nswitches. Each switch is connected to light. It\u2019s which light each\r\nswitch is connected to. When all switches are off, all lights are also\r\noff. If a switch is toggled (from on to off, or vice versa), the state\r\nof the light connected to it will also toggle. Alice brings the circuit,\r\nwhich shows only the states of the 2n switches, to her sister Iris and\r\ngives her a riddle: what is the minimum and maximum number of lights\r\nthat can be turned on?Knowing her little sister\u2019s antics too well, Iris\r\ntakes no more than a second to give Alice a correct answer. Can you do\r\nthe same?\r\n",
