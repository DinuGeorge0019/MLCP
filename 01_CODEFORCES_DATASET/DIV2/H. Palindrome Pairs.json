Palindrome Pairs", "statement": "After learning a lot about space exploration, a little girl named Ana\r\nwants to change the subject.Ana is a girl who loves palindromes (string\r\nthat can be read the same backwards as forward). She has learned how to\r\ncheck for a given string whether it\u2019s a palindrome or not, but soon she\r\ngrew tired of this problem, so she came up with a more interesting one\r\nand she needs your help to solve it:You are given an array of strings\r\nwhich consist of only small letters of the alphabet. Your task is to\r\nfind palindrome pairs are there in the array. A palindrome pair is a\r\npair of strings such that the following condition holds: permutation of\r\nthe concatenation of the two strings is a palindrome. In other words, if\r\nyou have two strings, let\u2019s say \"\" and \"\", and you concatenate them into\r\n\"\", we have to check if there exists a permutation of this new string\r\nsuch that it is a palindrome (in this case there exists the permutation\r\n\"\"). Two pairs are considered different if the strings are located on .\r\nThe pair of strings with indices (i,j) is considered as the pair (j,i).\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int N = 2e5 + 100;\n\nint n;\nint a[N], f, x;\n\nunordered_map <int, int> cnt;\n\nint main() {\n    #ifdef LOCAL\n    freopen(\"in\", \"r\", stdin);\n    #endif\n\n    ios_base :: sync_with_stdio(0);\n    cin.tie(0);\n\n    cin >> n;\n\n    long long ans = 0;\n    \n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n    \tstring s;\n    \tcin >> s;\n    \tint c = 0;\n    \tfor (auto it : s) {\n    \t\tc ^= (1 << (it - 'a'));\n    \t}\n\t\tint pairs = 0;\n\t\tpairs += cnt[c];\n\t\tfor (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {\n\t\t\tc ^= (1 << i);\n\t\t\tpairs += cnt[c];\n\t\t\tc ^= (1 << i);\n\t\t}\n\t\tans += pairs;\n\t\t++cnt[c];\n    }\n\t\n\tcout << ans;\t\n\t\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["bitmasks", "hashing"], "dificulty": "1600", "interactive": false}
