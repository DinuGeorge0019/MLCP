The worst\r\nmark is , the best is . Mark that is going to the certificate, is\r\ncalculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest\r\ninteger. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For\r\nexample, is rounded to , but and to . For instance, if Noora has marks ,\r\nthen the mark to the certificate is , because the average is equal to\r\nand rounded to , but if the marks are , Noora will have graduation\r\ncertificate with .To graduate with A certificate, Noora .Noora got marks\r\nin register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not\r\nenough to get final mark . Noora decided to ask for help in the\r\ninternet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is\r\nready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of\r\nadditional marks from to . At the same time, Leha want his hack be\r\nunseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional\r\nmarks. Please help Leha to calculate the minimal number of marks he has\r\nto add, so that final Noora’s mark will become equal to .\r\n",
