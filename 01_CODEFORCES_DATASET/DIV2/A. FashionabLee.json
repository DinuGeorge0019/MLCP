(proof is\r\nleft as an exercise for the reader)Consider a rotation such that an edge\r\nis parallel to -axis and an edge is parallel to -axis, then ( and are\r\nperpendicular, i. e. the angle between them is degrees), we can see that\r\nthere exist a third edge such that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also parallel to -axis and a\r\nforth edge such that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also parallel to -axis, so and and .
