Circle Metro", "statement": "The circle line of the Roflanpolis subway has n stations.There are two\r\nparallel routes in the subway. The first one visits stations in order 1\r\nto 2\r\nto\r\nldots\r\nto n\r\nto 1\r\nto 2\r\nto\r\nldots (so the next stop after station x is equal to (x+1) if x < n and 1\r\notherwise). The second route visits stations in order n\r\nto (n-1)\r\nto\r\nldots\r\nto 1\r\nto n\r\nto (n-1)\r\nto\r\nldots (so the next stop after station x is equal to (x-1) if x>1 and n\r\notherwise). All trains depart their stations simultaneously, and it\r\ntakes exactly 1 minute to arrive at the next station.Two toads live in\r\nthis city, their names are Daniel and Vlad.Daniel is currently in a\r\ntrain of the route at station a and will exit the subway when his train\r\nreaches station x.Coincidentally, Vlad is currently in a train of the\r\nroute at station b and he will exit the subway when his train reaches\r\nstation y.Surprisingly, all numbers a,x,b,y are distinct.Toad Ilya asks\r\nyou to check if Daniel and Vlad will ever be at the same station at the\r\nsame time during their journey. In other words, check if there is a\r\nmoment when their trains stop at the same station. Note that this\r\nincludes the moments when Daniel or Vlad enter or leave the subway.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\nint n;\nint a, b, c, d;\nint main()\n{\n    cin >> n >> a >> b >> c >> d;\n    while(a!=b && c!=d) {\n        if (a==c) {\n            cout << \"YES\";\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (a!=n) {\n            a++;\n        } else {\n            a=1;\n        }\n        if (c!=1) {\n            c--;\n        } else {\n            c=n;\n        }\n    }\n    if (a==c) {\n        cout << \"YES\";\n        return 0;\n    }\n    cout << \"NO\";\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation", "math"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
