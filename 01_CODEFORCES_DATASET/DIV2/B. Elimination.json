    "statement": "There is a famous olympiad, which has more than a hundred participants.\r\nThe Olympiad consists of two stages: the elimination stage, and the\r\nfinal stage. At least a hundred participants will advance to the final\r\nstage. The elimination stage in turn consists of two contests.A result\r\nof the elimination stage is the total score in two contests, but,\r\nunfortunately, the jury lost the final standings and has only standings\r\nfor the first and for the second contest separately. In each contest,\r\nthe participants are ranked by their point score in non-increasing\r\norder. When two participants have a tie (earned the same score), they\r\nare ranked by their passport number (in accordance with local\r\nregulations, all passport numbers are distinct). In the first contest,\r\nthe participant on the 100-th place scored a points. Also, the jury\r\nchecked all participants from the 1-st to the 100-th place (inclusive)\r\nin the first contest and found out that all of them have at least b\r\npoints in the second contest.Similarly, for the second contest, the\r\nparticipant on the 100-th place has c points. And the jury checked that\r\nall the participants from the 1-st to the 100-th place (inclusive) have\r\nat least d points in the first contest.After two contests, all\r\nparticipants are ranked by their total score in two contests in\r\nnon-increasing order. When participants have the same total score,\r\ntie-breaking with passport numbers is used. The to qualify to the final\r\nstage is the total score of the participant on the 100-th place.Given\r\nintegers a, b, c, d, please help the jury determine the smallest\r\npossible value of the cutoff score.\r\n",
