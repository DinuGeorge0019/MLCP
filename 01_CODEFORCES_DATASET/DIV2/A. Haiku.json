    "statement": "Haiku is a genre of Japanese traditional poetry.A haiku poem consists of\r\n17 syllables split into three phrases, containing 5, 7 and 5 syllables\r\ncorrespondingly (the first phrase should contain exactly 5 syllables,\r\nthe second phrase should contain exactly 7 syllables, and the third\r\nphrase should contain exactly 5 syllables). A haiku masterpiece contains\r\na description of a moment in those three phrases. Every word is\r\nimportant in a small poem, which is why haiku are rich with symbols.\r\nEach word has a special meaning, a special role. The main principle of\r\nhaiku is to say much using a few words.To simplify the matter, in the\r\ngiven problem we will consider that the number of syllable in the phrase\r\nis equal to the number of vowel letters there. Only the following\r\nletters are regarded as vowel letters: \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\".Three\r\nphases from a certain poem are given. Determine whether it is haiku or\r\nnot.\r\n",
