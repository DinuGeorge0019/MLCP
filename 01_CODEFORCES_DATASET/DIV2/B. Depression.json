Depression", "statement": "Do you remember a kind cartoon \"Beauty and the Beast\"? No, no, there was\r\nno firing from machine guns or radiation mutants time-travels!There was\r\na beauty named Belle. Once she had violated the Beast\u2019s order and\r\nvisited the West Wing. After that she was banished from the castle...\r\nEverybody was upset. The beautiful Belle was upset, so was the Beast, so\r\nwas Lumiere the candlestick. But the worst thing was that Cogsworth was\r\nupset. Cogsworth is not a human, but is the mantel clock, which was\r\noften used as an alarm clock.Due to Cogsworth\u2019s frustration all the\r\ninhabitants of the castle were in trouble: now they could not determine\r\nwhen it was time to drink morning tea, and when it was time for an\r\nevening stroll. Fortunately, deep in the basement are lying digital\r\nclock showing the time in the format . Now the residents of the castle\r\nface a difficult task. They should turn Cogsworth\u2019s hour and minute\r\nmustache hands in such a way, that Cogsworth began to show the correct\r\ntime. Moreover they need to find turn angles in degrees for each\r\nmustache hands. The initial time showed by Cogsworth is .You can only\r\nrotate the hands forward, that is, as is shown in the picture: As since\r\nthere are many ways too select such angles because of full rotations,\r\nchoose the smallest angles in the right (non-negative) direction.Note\r\nthat Cogsworth\u2019s hour and minute mustache hands move evenly and\r\ncontinuously. Hands are moving independently, so when turning one hand\r\nthe other hand remains standing still.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <algorithm>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cctype>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <queue>\n#include <list>\n#include <map>\n#include <numeric>\n#include <set>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\n#define VAR(a,b) __typeof(b) a=(b)\n#define FOR(i,a,b) for (int _n(b), i(a); i < _n; i++)\n#define FORD(i,a,b) for(int i=(a),_b=(b);i>=_b;--i)\n#define FOREACH(it,c) for(VAR(it,(c).begin());it!=(c).end();++it)\n#define REP(i,n) FOR(i,0,n)\n#define ALL(c) (c).begin(), (c).end()\n#define SORT(c) sort(ALL(c))\n#define REVERSE(c) reverse(ALL(c))\n#define UNIQUE(c) SORT(c),(c).resize(unique(ALL(c))-(c).begin())\n#define INF 1000000000\n#define X first\n#define Y second\n#define pb push_back\n#define SZ(c) (c).size()\ntypedef pair<int, int> PII;\ntypedef vector<int> VI;\ntypedef vector<PII> VPII;\ntypedef vector<VI> VVI;\n\n\nint main()\n{\n\t//freopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n\t//freopen(\"output.txt\", \"w+\", stdout);\n\n\tint h, m;\n\tscanf(\"%d:%d\", &h, &m);\n\t//cout << h <<  \" \" << m << endl;\n\th%=12;\n\n\tlong double r1 = h*60+m;\n\tr1 /= 2;\n\tlong double r2 = m;\n\tr2 *= 6;\n\n\tprintf (\"%.1lf %.0lf\\n\", (double)r1, (double)r2);\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["geometry", "math"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
