Twins", "statement": "Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person\r\nthat looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It\u2019s hard to say if\r\nhaving something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a\r\ntwin, then you very well know what it\u2019s like.Now let\u2019s imagine a typical\r\nmorning in your family. You haven\u2019t woken up yet, and Mom is already\r\ngoing to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to\r\nleave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the\r\nschool cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of\r\ncoins, or to be exact, coins of arbitrary values . But as Mom was\r\nrunning out of time, she didn\u2019t split the coins for you two. So she\r\nscribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.As you woke up,\r\nyou found Mom\u2019s coins and read her note. \"But why split the money\r\nequally?\" you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won\u2019t\r\nknow anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some\r\nsubset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is than the sum\r\nof values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you\r\ncorrectly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect\r\nthe deception. So, you\u2019ve decided to stick to the following strategy to\r\navoid suspicions: you take the , whose sum of values is strictly more\r\nthan the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine\r\nwhat number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described\r\nmanner.\r\n", "solutions": ["/*\n * a.cpp\n *\n *  Created on: 2012-3-6\n *      Author: mac\n */\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <climits>\n#include <numeric>\n#define foreach(e,x) for(__typeof(x.begin()) e=x.begin();e!=x.end();++e)\n#define REP(i,n) for(int i=0;i<n;++i)\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tint n;\n\tcin >> n;\n\tint dp[12000];\n\tfill(dp, dp + 12000, INT_MAX / 2);\n\tdp[0] = 0;\n\tint sum = 0;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\t\tint a;\n\t\tcin >> a;\n\t\tsum += a;\n\t\tfor (int j = 12000 - 1; j >= 0; --j) {\n\t\t\tif (j + a < 12000)\n\t\t\t\tdp[j + a] = min(dp[j + a], dp[j] + 1);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tint ans = INT_MAX / 2;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < 12000; ++i) {\n\t\tif (i + i > sum)\n\t\t\tans = min(ans, dp[i]);\n\t}\n\tcout << ans << endl;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy", "sortings"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
