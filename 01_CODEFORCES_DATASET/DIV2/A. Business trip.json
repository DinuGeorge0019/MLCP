His parents had left\r\nhim with duties: he should water their favourite flower all year, each\r\nday, in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening. \"Wait a\r\nsecond!\" thought Petya. He know for a fact that if he fulfills the\r\nparents\u2019 task in the -th () month of the year, then the flower will grow\r\nby centimeters, and if he doesn\u2019t water the flower in the -th month,\r\nthen the flower won\u2019t grow this month. Petya also knows that try as he\r\nmight, his parents won\u2019t believe that he has been watering the flower if\r\nit grows strictly less than by centimeters. Help Petya choose the\r\nminimum number of months when he will water the flower, given that the\r\nflower should grow no less than by centimeters.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <string>\n#include <queue>\n#include <map>\n#include <set>\n\n#define MAX 1024\n\nusing namespace std;\nFILE *in; FILE *out;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n\tin = stdin; out = stdout;\n//\tin = fopen(\"A.in\", \"rt\"); out = fopen(\"A.out\", \"wt\");\n\t\n\tint k;\n\tint a[12];\n\tfscanf(in, \"%d\", &k);\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < 12; i++)\n\t\tfscanf(in, \"%d\", &a[i]);\n\t\n\tint ans = 13;\n\tfor (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << 12); mask++)\n\t{\n\t\tint cnt = 0, sum = 0;\n\t\tfor (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) if (mask & (1 << i))\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tcnt++;\n\t\t\tsum += a[i];\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (sum >= k) ans = min(ans, cnt);\n\t}\n\tfprintf(out, \"%d\\n\", ans > 12 ? -1 : ans);\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy", "implementation", "sortings"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
