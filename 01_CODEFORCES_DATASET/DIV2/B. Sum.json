Sum", "statement": "Vasya studies positional numeral systems. Unfortunately, he often\r\nforgets to write the base of notation in which the expression is\r\nwritten. Once he saw a note in his notebook saying , and that the base\r\nof the positional notation wasn t written anywhere. Now Vasya has to\r\nchoose a base and regard the expression as written in the base\r\npositional notation. Vasya understood that he can get different results\r\nwith different bases, and some bases are even invalid. For example,\r\nexpression in the base 16 positional notation is equal to , in the base\r\n15 positional notation it is equal to , in the base 10 one to , in the\r\nbase 9 one to , and in the base 8 or lesser-based positional notations\r\nthe expression is invalid as all the numbers should be strictly less\r\nthan the positional notation base. Vasya got interested in what is the\r\nlength of the longest possible expression value. Help him to find this\r\nlength.The length of a number should be understood as the number of\r\nnumeric characters in it. For example, the length of the longest answer\r\nfor is 3. It is calculated like that in the base 15 (), base 10 (), base\r\n9 () positional notations, for example, and in some other ones.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<cstdio>\n#include<algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\nint main()\n{\n  int a,b;\n  scanf(\"%d%d\",&a,&b);\n  int base=0;\n  int x=a;\n  //int y=b;\n  int i;\n  while(x)\n  {\n    i=x%10;\n    x/=10;\n    base = max(base,i+1);\n  }\n  x=b;\n  while(x)\n  {\n    i=x%10;\n    x/=10;\n    base = max(base,i+1);\n  }\n//   printf(\"base - %d\\n\",base);\n  int c=0;\n  int cnt=0;\n  while(a&&b)\n  {\n if((a%10+b%10+c)>=base)\n {\n   c = (a%10+b%10+c)/base;\n//   printf(\"true %d\\n\",c);\n }\n    else c=0;\n    cnt++;\n    a/=10;\n    a+=c;\n    c=0;\n    b/=10;\n    \n  }\n//   printf(\"%d %d %d\\n\",a,b,c);\n  while(a)\n  {\n    if((a%10+b%10+c)>=base)\n    c = (a%10+b%10+c)/base;\n    else c=0;\n    cnt++;\n    a/=10;\n    a+=c;\n    c=0;\n    b/=10;\n  }\n// printf(\"%d %d %d\\n\",a,b,c);\n    while(b)\n  {\nif((a%10+b%10+c)>=base)\n    c = (a%10+b%10+c)/base;\n    else c=0;\n    cnt++;\n    b/=10;\n    b+=c;\n    c=0;\n   \n  }\n//  printf(\"%d %d %d\\n\",a,b,c);\n  printf(\"%d\\n\",cnt);\n  return 0;\n\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math"], "dificulty": "1500", "interactive": false}
