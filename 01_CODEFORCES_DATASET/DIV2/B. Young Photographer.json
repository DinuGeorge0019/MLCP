That was the reason why he placed himself in\r\nposition of a long straight racetrack and got ready to take pictures.\r\nBut the problem was that not all the runners passed him. The total\r\namount of sportsmen, training at that racetrack, equals . And each of\r\nthem regularly runs distances within a particular segment of the\r\nracetrack, which is the same for each sportsman. For example, the first\r\nsportsman runs from position to position , the second from to What is\r\nthe minimum distance that Bob should move to have a chance to take\r\npictures of each sportsman? Bob can take a picture of a sportsman, if he\r\nstands within the segment that this sportsman covers on the racetrack.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<algorithm>\n#include<iostream>\n#include<iomanip>\n#include<cstring>\n#include<vector>\n#include<string>\n#include<cmath>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint n , L[1001] , R[1001] , now;\n\nbool check(int t)\n{\n    for(int i = 1 ; i <= n ; i++)\n        if(L[i] > t || R[i] < t)\n            return false;\n    return true;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    while(cin>>n>>now)\n    {\n        for(int i = 1 ; i <= n ; i++)\n        {\n            cin>>L[i]>>R[i];\n            if(L[i] > R[i])\n                swap(L[i] , R[i]);\n        }\n        int d = 10000;\n        for(int i = 0 ; i <= 1000 ; i++)\n            if(check(i))\n            {\n                d = min(d , abs(now - i));\n            }\n        if(d == 10000)\n            cout<<-1<<endl;\n        else\n            cout<<d<<endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "1000", "interactive": false}
