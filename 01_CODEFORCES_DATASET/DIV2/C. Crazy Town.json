Each road\r\nis defined by the equation , where and are not both equal to the zero.\r\nThe roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite\r\nspace. Let\u2019s call each such region a block. We define an intersection as\r\nthe point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is\r\nlocated in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University,\r\nalso located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to\r\nanother, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular,\r\nthis means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have\r\nno shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from\r\none to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of\r\nsteps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.\r\nIt is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on\r\nthe road.\r\n",

So, all\r\nwe need to do is to cross all these lines, so the answer is the number\r\nof these lines. To check if two points lies on different sides of a line\r\none can simply use its coordinates to place in line equation and check\r\nif these two values have different signs.
