Each gate\r\nperforms one of two operations: (): Increases the number of people in a\r\nlane by a constant amount a. (): Multiplies the current number of people\r\nin a lane by an integer a. This means the number of people increases by\r\n(a - 1) times the current count in that lane. The additional people\r\ngained from each operation can be assigned to either lane. However,\r\npeople already in a lane be moved to the other lane.Initially, there is\r\none person in each lane. Your task is to determine the maximum total\r\nnumber of people that can be achieved by the end of the level.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["dp", "greedy", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1800", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV2\\D.
