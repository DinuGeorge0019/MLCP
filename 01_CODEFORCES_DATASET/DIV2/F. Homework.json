    "statement": "Some teachers work at the educational center \"Sirius\" while\r\nsimultaneously studying at the university. In this case, the trip does\r\nnot exempt them from completing their homework, so they do their\r\nhomework right on the plane. Artem is one of those teachers, and he was\r\nassigned the following homework at the university.With an arbitrary\r\nstring a of length m, he can perform the following operation. Artem\r\nsplits the string a into two halves x and y of equal length, after which\r\nhe performs of three actions: For each i\r\nin\r\nleft\r\n{ 1, 2,\r\nldots,\r\nfrac{m}{2}\r\nright\r\n} assign x_i = (x_i + y_i)\r\nbmod 2; For each i\r\nin\r\nleft\r\n{ 1, 2,\r\nldots,\r\nfrac{m}{2}\r\nright\r\n} assign y_i = (x_i + y_i)\r\nbmod 2; Perform an arbitrary number of operations (the same operations\r\ndefined above, applied recursively) on the strings x and y,\r\nindependently of each other. Note that in this case, the strings x and y\r\nmust be of even length. After that, the string a is replaced by the\r\nstrings x and y, concatenated in the same order.Unfortunately, Artem\r\nfell asleep on the plane, so you will have to complete his homework.\r\nArtem has two binary strings s and t of length n, each consisting of n\r\ncharacters or . Determine whether it is possible to make string s equal\r\nto string t with number of operations.\r\n",
