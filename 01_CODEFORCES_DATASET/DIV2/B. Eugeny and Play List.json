Eugenyâ€™s\r\nplay list is organized as follows: first song number plays times, then\r\nsong number plays times, , in the end the song number plays times.Eugeny\r\ntook a piece of paper and wrote out moments of time when he liked a\r\nsong. Now for each such moment he wants to know the number of the song\r\nthat played at that moment. The moment means that Eugeny wants to know\r\nwhich song was playing during the -th minute of his listening to the\r\nplay list.Help Eugeny and calculate the required numbers of songs.\r\n",
