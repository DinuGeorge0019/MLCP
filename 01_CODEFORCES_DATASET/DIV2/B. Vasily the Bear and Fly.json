Circles with numbers from to had centers at points ,\r\n, , , respectively. Circles with numbers from to had centers at points ,\r\n, , , respectively. Naturally, the bear painted the circles for a simple\r\nexperiment with a fly. The experiment continued for days. Each day of\r\nthe experiment got its own unique number from to , inclusive. On the day\r\nnumber the following things happened: The fly arrived at the coordinate\r\nplane at the center of the circle with number ( is the result of\r\ndividing number by number , rounded down to an integer). The fly went\r\nalong the coordinate plane to the center of the circle number ( is the\r\nremainder after dividing number by number ). The bear noticed that the\r\nfly went from the center of circle to the center of circle along the\r\nshortest path with all points lying on the border or inside at least one\r\nof the circles. After the fly reached the center of circle , it flew\r\naway in an unknown direction. Help Vasily, count the average distance\r\nthe fly went along the coordinate plane during each of these days.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <math.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint m, i;\ndouble Now, S, r, dis[100005], s[100005];\n\nint main()\n{\n\tscanf(\"%d %lf\", &m, &r);\n\tdis[0] = r * 2.0;\n\tdis[1] = r * 2.0 + r * sqrt(2.0);\n\tdis[2] = r * 2.0 + 2 * r * sqrt(2.0);\n\tfor (i = 3; i <= m; i++)\n\t\tdis[i] = dis[i - 1] + r * 2.0;\n\ts[0] = dis[0];\n\tfor (i = 1; i <= m; i++)\n\t\ts[i] = s[i - 1] + dis[i];\n\tfor (i = 1; i <= m; i++)\n\t{\n\t\tNow = s[i - 1] + s[m - i] - dis[0];\n\t\tNow /= (double)(m);\n\t\tS += Now;\n\t}\n\t\n\tS /= (double)(m);\n\tprintf(\"%.10lf\\n\", S);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math"], "dificulty": "1900", "interactive": false}
