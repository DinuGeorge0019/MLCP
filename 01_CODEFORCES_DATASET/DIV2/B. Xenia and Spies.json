Xenia and Spies", "statement": "Xenia the vigorous detective faced foreign spies lined up in a row.\r\nWe\u2019ll consider the spies numbered from 1 to from left to right. Spy has\r\nan important note. He has to pass the note to spy . Xenia interrogates\r\nthe spies in several steps. During one step the spy keeping the\r\nimportant note can pass the note to one of his neighbours in the row. In\r\nother words, if this spy\u2019s number is , he can pass the note to another\r\nspy, either or (if or , then the spy has only one neighbour). Also\r\nduring a step the spy can keep a note and not pass it to anyone.But\r\nnothing is that easy. During steps Xenia watches some spies attentively.\r\nSpecifically, during step (steps are numbered from 1) Xenia watches\r\nspies numbers . Of course, if during some step a spy is watched, he\r\ncan\u2019t do anything: neither give the note nor take it from some other\r\nspy. Otherwise, Xenia reveals the spies\u2019 cunning plot. Nevertheless, if\r\nthe spy at the current step keeps the note, Xenia sees nothing\r\nsuspicious even if she watches him.You\u2019ve got and . Also, you have the\r\nsteps during which Xenia watches spies and which spies she is going to\r\nwatch during each step. Find the best way the spies should act in order\r\nto pass the note from spy to spy as quickly as possible (in the minimum\r\nnumber of steps).\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <queue>\n#define lson step << 1\n#define rson step << 1 | 1\n#define lowbit(x) (x & (-x))\n#define Key_value ch[ch[root][1]][0] \nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\nconst int N = 500005;\nconst int inf = 1000000009;\nint n , m , s , f;\nint t[N] , l[N] , r[N];\nint main () {\n    #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE\n        freopen (\"input.txt\" , \"r\" , stdin);\n        // freopen (\"output.txt\" , \"w\" , stdout);\n    #endif\n    cin >> n >> m >> s >> f;\n    for (int i = 0 ; i < m ; i ++) {\n        cin >> t[i] >> l[i] >> r[i];\n    }\n    int sgn = (f - s) > 0 ? 1 : -1;\n    for (int i = 1 , j = 0 ; ; i ++) {\n        if (s == f) break;\n        int nxt = s + sgn;\n        if (j < m && t[j] == i) {\n            if ((s >= l[j] && s <= r[j]) || (nxt >= l[j] && nxt <= r[j]))\n                putchar ('X');\n            else {\n                s = nxt;\n                if (sgn > 0) putchar ('R');\n                else putchar ('L');\n            }\n            j ++;\n        }\n        else {\n            s = nxt;\n            if (sgn > 0) putchar ('R');\n            else putchar ('L');\n        }\n    }\n    puts (\"\");\n    return 0;\n}       \n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "greedy", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1500", "interactive": false}
