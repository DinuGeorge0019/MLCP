    "statement": "Nothing has changed since the last round. Dima and Inna still love each\r\nother and want to be together. They’ve made a deal with Seryozha and now\r\nthey need to make a deal with the dorm guards...There are four\r\nguardposts in Dima’s dorm. Each post contains two guards (in Russia they\r\nare usually elderly women). You can bribe a guard by a chocolate bar or\r\na box of juice. For each guard you know the minimum price of the\r\nchocolate bar she can accept as a gift and the minimum price of the box\r\nof juice she can accept as a gift. If a chocolate bar for some guard\r\ncosts less than the minimum chocolate bar price for this guard is, or if\r\na box of juice for some guard costs less than the minimum box of juice\r\nprice for this guard is, then the guard doesn’t accept such a gift.In\r\norder to pass through a guardpost, one needs to bribe both guards.The\r\nshop has an unlimited amount of juice and chocolate of any price\r\nstarting with . Dima wants to choose some guardpost, buy one gift for\r\neach guard from the guardpost and spend rubles on it.Help him choose a\r\npost through which he can safely sneak Inna or otherwise say that this\r\nis impossible. Mind you, Inna would be very sorry to hear that!\r\n",
