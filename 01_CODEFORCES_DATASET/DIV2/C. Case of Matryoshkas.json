According to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka\r\ndolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as\r\nseveral separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal,\r\nfollowing the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them\r\ninto a single large chain ().
