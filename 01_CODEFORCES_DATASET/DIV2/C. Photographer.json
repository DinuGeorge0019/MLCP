Photographer", "statement": "Valera\u2019s lifelong ambition was to be a photographer, so he bought a new\r\ncamera. Every day he got more and more clients asking for photos, and\r\none day Valera needed a program that would determine the maximum number\r\nof people he can serve.The camera\u2019s memory is megabytes. Valera\u2019s camera\r\ncan take photos of high and low quality. One low quality photo takes\r\nmegabytes of memory, one high quality photo take megabytes of memory.\r\nFor unknown reasons, each client asks him to make several low quality\r\nphotos and several high quality photos. More formally, the -th client\r\nasks to make low quality photos and high quality photos.Valera wants to\r\nserve as many clients per day as possible, provided that they will be\r\npleased with his work. To please the -th client, Valera needs to give\r\nhim everything he wants, that is, to make low quality photos and high\r\nquality photos. To make one low quality photo, the camera must have at\r\nleast megabytes of free memory space. Similarly, to make one high\r\nquality photo, the camera must have at least megabytes of free memory\r\nspace. Initially the camera\u2019s memory is empty. Valera also does not\r\ndelete photos from the camera so that the camera\u2019s memory gradually\r\nfills up.Calculate the maximum number of clients Valera can successfully\r\nserve and print the numbers of these clients.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<iostream>\n#include<fstream>\n#include<cstdio>\n#include<cstdlib>\n#include<cstring>\n#include<algorithm>\n#include<iomanip>\n#include<string>\n#include<vector>\n#include<map>\n#include<queue>\n#include<ctime>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint a[100005][2];\nint n,d,p,q;;\nint stk[1000005];\n\ninline int cmp(const void *a,const void *b)\n{\n\treturn ((int*)a)[0]-((int*)b)[0];\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n\tscanf(\"%d%d%d%d\",&n,&d,&p,&q);\n\tfor(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\n\t{\n\t\tint x,y;\n\t\tscanf(\"%d%d\",&x,&y);\n\t\ta[i][0]=x*p+y*q;\n\t\ta[i][1]=i;\n\t}\n\tqsort(a+1,n,sizeof(a[0]),cmp);\n\tint ans=0;\n\tfor(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\n\t{\n\t\tif(a[i][0]<=d)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\td-=a[i][0];\n\t\t\tans++;\n\t\t\tstk[ans]=a[i][1];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tprintf(\"%d\\n\",ans);\n\tfor(int i=1;i<=ans;i++)\n\tprintf(\"%d \",stk[i]);\n\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}\n/*\n3 10\n2 3\n1 4\n2 1\n1 0\n*/\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy", "sortings"], "dificulty": "1400", "interactive": false}
