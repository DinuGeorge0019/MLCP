Vanya\r\nbecame sad and started looking for the cards but he only found of them.\r\nVanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found\r\ncards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for\r\ncards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he\r\nneed to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially\r\nVanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from to .\r\n",
