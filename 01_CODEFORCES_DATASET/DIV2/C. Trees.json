    "statement": "On Bertown\u2019s main street trees are growing, the tree number has the\r\nheight of meters (). By the arrival of the President of Berland these\r\ntrees were decided to be changed so that their heights formed a\r\nsequence. This means that the heights of trees on ends (the st one and\r\nthe -th one) should be equal to each other, the heights of the -nd and\r\nthe -th tree must also be equal to each other, at that the height of the\r\n-nd tree should be larger than the height of the first tree by , and so\r\non. In other words, the heights of the trees, standing at equal distance\r\nfrom the edge (of one end of the sequence) must be equal to each other,\r\nand with the increasing of the distance from the edge by the tree height\r\nmust also increase by . For example, the sequences \"\" and \"\" are\r\nbeautiful, and \u2019\" and \"\" are not. Changing the height of a tree is a\r\nvery expensive operation, using advanced technologies invented by\r\nBerland scientists. In one operation you can choose any tree and change\r\nits height to any number, either increase or decrease. Note that even\r\nafter the change the height should remain a positive integer, i. e, it\r\ncan\u2019t be less than or equal to zero. Identify the smallest number of\r\nchanges of the trees\u2019 height needed for the sequence of their heights to\r\nbecome beautiful.\r\n",
