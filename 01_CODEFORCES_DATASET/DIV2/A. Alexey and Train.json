    "statement": "Alexey is travelling on a train. Unfortunately, due to the bad weather,\r\nthe train moves slower that it should!Alexey took the train at the\r\nrailroad terminal. Let’s say that the train starts from the terminal at\r\nthe moment 0. Also, let’s say that the train will visit n stations\r\nnumbered from 1 to n along its way, and that Alexey destination is the\r\nstation n.Alexey learned from the train schedule n integer pairs (a_i,\r\nb_i) where a_i is the expected time of train’s arrival at the i-th\r\nstation and b_i is the expected time of departure.Also, using all\r\ninformation he has, Alexey was able to calculate n integers tm_1, tm_2,\r\ndots, tm_n where tm_i is the extra time the train need to travel from\r\nthe station i - 1 to the station i. Formally, the train needs exactly\r\na_i - b_{i-1} + tm_i time to travel from station i - 1 to station i (if\r\ni = 1 then b_0 is the moment the train leave the terminal, and it’s\r\nequal to 0).The train leaves the station i, if both conditions are met:\r\nit’s on the station for at least\r\nleft\r\nlceil\r\nfrac{b_i - a_i}{2}\r\nright\r\nrceil units of time (division with ceiling); current time\r\nge b_i. Since Alexey spent all his energy on prediction of time delays,\r\nhelp him to calculate the time of at the station n.\r\n",
