Chord", "statement": "Vasya studies music. He has learned lots of interesting stuff. For\r\nexample, he knows that there are 12 notes: , , , , , , , , , , , . He\r\nalso knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after goes again, and\r\nbefore stands . We will consider the note in the row\u2019s beginning and the\r\nnote after the similar and we will identify them with each other. The\r\ndistance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones:\r\nbetween two consecutive notes there\u2019s exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5\r\ntone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that\r\nis, the distance between and is 4 semitones and between and is 8\r\nsemitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set\r\nof no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with\r\ntriads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He\r\ncan already distinguish between two types of triads major and\r\nminor.Let\u2019s define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes , and .\r\nIf we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale\r\nbetween and equals 4 semitones and the distance between and is 3\r\nsemitones, then the triad is major. The distance between and ,\r\naccordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the\r\ndistance between and should be 3 semitones and between and 4\r\nsemitones.For example, the triad \"\" is major: between and are 4\r\nsemitones, and between and are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"\" is minor,\r\nbecause if we order the notes as \"\", than between and will be 3\r\nsemitones, and between and 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the\r\nteacher has given to him.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<stdio.h>\n#include<string>\n#include<map>\n#include<algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\nmap<string,int> XD;\nchar all[12][3]={\n    \"C\", \"C#\", \"D\", \"D#\", \"E\", \"F\", \"F#\", \"G\", \"G#\", \"A\", \"B\", \"H\"\n};\nint gn(){\n    char tmp[3];\n    scanf(\"%s\",tmp);\n    return XD[tmp];\n}\nint a[3];\nbool ismajor(){\n    return a[1]==(a[0]+4)%12&&a[2]==(a[1]+3)%12;\n}\nbool isminor(){\n    return a[1]==(a[0]+3)%12&&a[2]==(a[1]+4)%12;\n}\nint main(){\n    int i;\n    for(i=0;i<12;i++)XD[all[i]]=i;\n    for(i=0;i<3;i++)a[i]=gn();\n    sort(a,a+3);\n    do{\n\tif(ismajor()){\n\t    puts(\"major\");\n\t    return 0;\n\t}\n\tif(isminor()){\n\t    puts(\"minor\");\n\t    return 0;\n\t}\n    }while(next_permutation(a,a+3));\n    puts(\"strange\");\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
