    "statement": "Natasha is going to fly to Mars. Finally, Natasha sat in the rocket. She\r\nflies, flies... but gets bored. She wishes to arrive to Mars already! So\r\nshe decides to find something to occupy herself. She couldn’t think of\r\nanything better to do than to calculate the distance to the red\r\nplanet.Let’s define x as the distance to Mars. Unfortunately, Natasha\r\ndoes not know x. But it is known that 1\r\nle x\r\nle m, where Natasha knows the number m. Besides, x and m are positive\r\nintegers.Natasha can ask the rocket questions. Every question is an\r\ninteger y (1\r\nle y\r\nle m). The correct answer to the question is -1, if x<y, 0, if x=y, and\r\n1, if x>y. But the rocket is broken it does not always answer correctly.\r\nPrecisely: let the correct answer to the current question be equal to t,\r\nthen, if the rocket answers this question correctly, then it will answer\r\nt, otherwise it will answer -t.In addition, the rocket has a sequence p\r\nof length n. Each element of the sequence is either 0 or 1. The rocket\r\nprocesses this sequence in the cyclic order, that is 1-st element, 2-nd,\r\n3-rd,\r\nldots, (n-1)-th, n-th, 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd,\r\nldots, (n-1)-th, n-th,\r\nldots. If the current element is 1, the rocket answers correctly, if 0\r\nlies. Natasha doesn’t know the sequence p, but she knows its length\r\nn.You can ask the rocket no more than 60 questions.Help Natasha find the\r\ndistance to Mars. Assume, that the distance to Mars does not change\r\nwhile Natasha is asking questions.Your solution will not be accepted, if\r\nit does not receive an answer 0 from the rocket (even if the distance to\r\nMars is uniquely determined by the already received rocket’s answers).\r\n",

Otherwise, it is clear that the\r\ncorrect answer is \"1\" (that is, the distance to Mars is greater than\r\none). If -th answer of rocket is \"1\", then (that is, the rocket answered\r\nthe truth), otherwise (untruth). On this, we will spend no more than\r\nqueries, within the given constraints it is .Now you can find the number\r\nusing binary search.
