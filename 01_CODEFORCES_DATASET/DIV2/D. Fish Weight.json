We claim that the answer is YES if and only if exists a is lexicographically larger than b.\n\n If a is not lexicographcally larger than b, that means for every i, ai???bi. That implies for every fish Alice has, there is a corresponding fish Bob has and is as heavy as Alice's.\n\n Let i be the smallest index such that ai?>?bi. We can amplify the gap between wai and wbi as large as we want to make Alice wins.",
