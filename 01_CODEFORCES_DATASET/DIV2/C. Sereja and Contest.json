    "statement": "During the last Sereja’s Codesecrof round the server crashed many times,\r\nso the round was decided to be made unrated for some participants. Let’s\r\nassume that people took part in the contest. Let’s assume that the\r\nparticipant who got the first place has rating , the second place\r\nparticipant has rating , , the -th place participant has rating . Then\r\nchanging the rating on the Codesecrof site is calculated by the formula\r\n.After the round was over, the Codesecrof management published the\r\nparticipants’ results table. They decided that if for a participant ,\r\nthen the round can be considered unrated for him. But imagine the\r\nmanagement’s surprise when they found out that the participants’ rating\r\ntable is dynamic. In other words, when some participant is removed from\r\nthe rating, he is removed from the results’ table and the rating is\r\nrecalculated according to the new table. And of course, all applications\r\nfor exclusion from the rating are considered in view of the current\r\ntable.We know that among all the applications for exclusion from the\r\nrating the first application to consider is from the participant with\r\nthe best rank (the rank with the minimum number), for who . We also know\r\nthat the applications for exclusion from rating were submitted by all\r\nparticipants.Now Sereja wonders, what is the number of participants to\r\nbe excluded from the contest rating, and the numbers of the participants\r\nin the original table in the order of their exclusion from the rating.\r\nPay attention to the analysis of the first test case for a better\r\nunderstanding of the statement.\r\n",
