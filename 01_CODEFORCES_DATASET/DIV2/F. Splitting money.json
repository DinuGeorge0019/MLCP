After long\r\nnegotiations, Bitcoin was ultimately chosen as the universal\r\ncurrency.These were the great news for Alice, whose grandfather got into\r\nBitcoin mining in 2013, and accumulated a lot of them throughout the\r\nyears. Unfortunately, when paying something in bitcoin everyone can see\r\nhow many bitcoins you have in your public address wallet. This worried\r\nAlice, so she decided to split her bitcoins among multiple different\r\naddresses, so that every address has at most x satoshi (1 bitcoin = 10^8\r\nsatoshi). She can create new public address wallets for free and is\r\nwilling to pay f fee in satoshi per transaction to ensure acceptable\r\nspeed of transfer. The fee is deducted from the address the transaction\r\nwas sent from. Tell Alice how much total fee in satoshi she will need to\r\npay to achieve her goal.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int N = 2e5 + 100;\n\nint n;\nint a[N], f, x;\n\nint main() {\n    #ifdef LOCAL\n    freopen(\"in\", \"r\", stdin);\n    #endif\n\n    ios_base :: sync_with_stdio(0);\n    cin.tie(0);\n\n    cin >> n;\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n    \tcin >> a[i];\n    }\n    cin >> x >> f;\n\tlong long ans = 0;\t\n\tfor (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n\t\tint l = -1, r = 1e9 + 7;\n\t\twhile (r - l > 1) {\n\t\t\tint mid = (r + l) / 2;\n\t\t\tif (a[i] - mid * 1ll * (f + x) <= x)\n\t\t\t\tr = mid;\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\tl = mid;\n\t\t}\n\t\tans += f * r;\n\t}\n\t\n\tcout << ans;\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "1400", "interactive": false}
