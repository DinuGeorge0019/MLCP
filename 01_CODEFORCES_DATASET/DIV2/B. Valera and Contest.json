Today he has participated in the contest with his team,\r\nconsisting of students (including Valera). This contest was an\r\nindividual competition, so each student in the team solved problems\r\nindividually.After the contest was over, Valera was interested in\r\nresults. He found out that: each student in the team scored at least\r\npoints and at most points; in total, all members of the team scored\r\nexactly points; the total score of the members of the team who scored\r\nthe most points is equal to exactly ; more formally, if is the sequence\r\nof points earned by the team of students in the non-increasing order ,\r\nthen . However, Valera did not find out exactly how many points each of\r\nstudents scored. Valera asked you to recover any distribution of scores\r\nbetween the students of the team, such that all the conditions above are\r\nmet.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <queue>\n#include <vector>\n#include <map>\n#include <set>\n#include <algorithm>\n#define lowbit(x) ((x) & (-(x)))\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\nconst int N = 1005;\nint n , k , l , r , all , sub , a[N];\nint main () {\n    #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE\n        freopen (\"input.txt\" , \"r\" , stdin);\n    #endif\n    cin >> n >> k >> l >> r >> all >> sub;\n    all -= sub;\n    for (int i = 0 ; sub ; i ++ , sub --) {\n        a[i % k] ++;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0 ; all ; i ++ , all --) {\n        a[(i % (n - k)) + k] ++;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0 ; i < n ; i ++)\n        cout << a[i] << endl;\n    return 0;  \n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "implementation", "math"], "dificulty": "1400", "interactive": false}
