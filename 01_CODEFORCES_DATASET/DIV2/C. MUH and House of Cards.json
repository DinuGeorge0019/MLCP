MUH and House of Cards", "statement": "Polar bears Menshykov and Uslada from the zoo of St. Petersburg and\r\nelephant Horace from the zoo of Kiev decided to build a house of cards.\r\nFor that they\u2019ve already found a hefty deck of playing cards. Let\u2019s\r\ndescribe the house they want to make: The house consists of some\r\nnon-zero number of floors. Each floor consists of a non-zero number of\r\nrooms and the ceiling. A room is two cards that are leaned towards each\r\nother. The rooms are made in a row, each two adjoining rooms share a\r\nceiling made by another card. Each floor besides for the lowest one\r\nshould contain less rooms than the floor below. Please note that the\r\nhouse may end by the floor with more than one room, and in this case\r\nthey also must be covered by the ceiling. Also, the number of rooms on\r\nthe adjoining floors doesn\u2019t have to differ by one, the difference may\r\nbe more. While bears are practicing to put cards, Horace tries to figure\r\nout how many floors their house should consist of. The height of the\r\nhouse is the number of floors in it. It is possible that you can make a\r\nlot of different houses of different heights out of cards. It seems that\r\nthe elephant cannot solve this problem and he asks you to count the\r\nnumber of the distinct heights of the houses that they can make using\r\ncards.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <vector>\n#include <list>\n#include <queue>\n#include <map>\n#include <set>\n#include <deque>\n#include <stack>\n#include <bitset>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <functional>\n#include <numeric>\n#include <utility>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <iomanip>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <tr1/unordered_set>\n#include <tr1/unordered_map>\n\nusing namespace std;\nusing namespace tr1;\n\nconst int maxn=2e6+5;\n\nlong long n,sum;\n\nint main(){\n    cin>>n;\n    sum=0;\n    int ans=0;\n    for(int i=1;i<maxn;i++){\n        sum+=3LL*i-1;\n        if(sum>n)break;\n        if((n-sum)%3==0)ans++;\n    }\n    cout<<ans<<endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "greedy", "math"], "dificulty": "1700", "interactive": false}
