    "editorial": "Main idea: reduction to system of linear equations and solving it using Gauss algorithm.\n\nLet's notice that order of columns in answer doesn't matter. That's why there is only one important thing  quantity of every type of column. There is only 24?=?16 different columns.\n\nLet's represent Hamming distance between every pair of strings as sum of quantities of types of columns. It's possible because every column adds to every distance between pairs 0 or 1.\n\nNow we have system of 6 linear equations with 16 variables. It's not good, let's decrease number of variables. First, some columns adds same values to every Hamming distance. For example strings \"abbb\" and \"baaa\". For every column q we can replace all letters \"a\" by letters \"b\" and all letters \"b\" by letters \"a\" and reach column that adds same values to every distance. We reduced number of variables to 8. We also can notice that columns \"aaaa\" and \"bbbb\" is useless and reduce number of variables to 7.\n\nThis system can be solved using Gauss algorithm. One variable steel be free. Let's fix it. It's value can't be more than maximum of h(si,?sj) because column adds positive value to one or more Hamming distance. For every fixed value we should check if all variables take non-negative integer value and choose the best answer.\n\nWe can solve system of equations in integers because coefficients of equation is little.\n\nComplexity of this solution if O(max(h(si,?sj))). If we solve it in rational numbers complexity will change to .",
