There is an urgent need\r\nto fix it. You have chosen to make the numbers of the items sequential,\r\nstarting with . Changing a number is quite a time-consuming process, and\r\nyou would like to make maximum use of the current numbering.You have\r\nbeen given information on current inventory numbers for items in the\r\ncompany.
