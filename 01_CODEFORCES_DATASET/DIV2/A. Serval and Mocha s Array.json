And for an array of at least 2 positive integers,\r\nit is iff all of its prefixes whose length is no less than 2 are good.\r\nFor example: [3,6] is not good, because\r\ngcd(3,6)=3 is greater than its length 2. [1,2,4] is both good and\r\nbeautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than 2,\r\nwhich are [1,2] and [1,2,4], are both good. [3,6,1] is good but not\r\nbeautiful, because [3,6] is not good. Now Mocha gives you the gift array\r\na of n positive integers, and she wants to know whether array a could\r\nbecome beautiful by reordering the elements in a. It is allowed to keep\r\nthe array a unchanged.\r\n",
