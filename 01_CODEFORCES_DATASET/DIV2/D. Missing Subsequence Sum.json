    "editorial": "Notice that for a fixed k\n, a solution for n=c\n is also a solution for all n<c\n. So we can ignore the value of n\n and just assume it's always 106\n.\n\nIf we didn't have the restriction that no subsequence can add up to k\n, the most natural solution would be [1,2,4,8,?219]\n. Every value from 1\n to 106\n appears as the sum of the subsequence given by its binary representation. We will use a modified version of this array to solve the problem.\n\nLet i\n be the largest integer such that 2i?k\n. We will use this array (of size 22\n):\n\na=[k?2i,k+1,k+1+2i,1,2,4,...2i?1,2i+1,...219]\n\nTo prove that no subsequence of a\n adds up to k\n, consider the list of all elements in the array that are at most k\n, since these are the only ones that could be present in a subsequence adding to k\n. These are\n\nk?2i,1,2,4,...2i?1\n\nSince these add up to k?1\n, no subsequence can add up to k\n.\n\nTo prove that for all 1?v?n\n where v?k\n, there is a subsequence adding up to v\n, we consider several cases:\n\nIf v<2i\n, we can simply use the binary representation of v\n.\nIf 2i?v<k\n, we can first take all of the elements that are at most k\n as part of our subsequence. We then need to remove elements with a sum equal to k?1?v\n. Because 2i?v<k<2i+1\n, k?1?v\n is less than 2i\n, so we can simply remove its binary representation.\nIf v>k\n, we can take k+1\n along with the binary representation of v?k?1\n. The one edge case is when the 2i\n bit is set in v?k?1\n. In this case, we replace k+1\n with k+1+2i\n.\nSo in all cases, we can form a subsequence adding up to v\n.",

    "statement": "You are given two integers n and k. Find a sequence a of non-negative\r\nintegers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.\r\nThere is no subsequence of a with a sum of k. For all 1\r\nle v\r\nle n where v\r\nne k, there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v. A sequence b is a\r\nsubsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of several\r\n(possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the\r\nremaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7,\r\n8, 2, 4, 3].It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution\r\nalways exists.\r\n",
