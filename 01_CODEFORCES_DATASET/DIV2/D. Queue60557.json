    "statement": "There are schoolchildren, boys and girls, lined up in the school canteen\r\nin front of the bun stall. The buns aren\u2019t ready yet and the line is\r\nundergoing some changes.Each second all boys that stand right in front\r\nof girls, simultaneously swap places with the girls (so that the girls\r\ncould go closer to the beginning of the line). In other words, if at\r\nsome time the -th position has a boy and the -th position has a girl,\r\nthen in a second, the -th position will have a girl and the -th one will\r\nhave a boy.Let\u2019s take an example of a line of four people: a boy, a boy,\r\na girl, a girl (from the beginning to the end of the line). Next second\r\nthe line will look like that: a boy, a girl, a boy, a girl. Next second\r\nit will be a girl, a boy, a girl, a boy. Next second it will be a girl,\r\na girl, a boy, a boy. The line won\u2019t change any more.Your task is: given\r\nthe arrangement of the children in the line to determine the time needed\r\nto move all girls in front of boys (in the example above it takes 3\r\nseconds). Baking buns takes a lot of time, so no one leaves the line\r\nuntil the line stops changing.\r\n",
