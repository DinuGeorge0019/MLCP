Let\u2019s index the guests of Maxim\u2019s\r\nrestaurant from 1 to . Maxim knows the sizes of all guests that are\r\ngoing to come to him. The -th guest\u2019s size () represents the number of\r\nmeters the guest is going to take up if he sits at the restaurant\r\ntable.Long before the dinner, the guests line up in a queue in front of\r\nthe restaurant in some order. Then Maxim lets the guests in, one by one.\r\nMaxim stops letting the guests in when there is no place at the\r\nrestaurant table for another guest in the queue. There is no place at\r\nthe restaurant table for another guest in the queue, if the sum of sizes\r\nof all guests in the restaurant plus the size of this guest from the\r\nqueue is larger than . In this case, not to offend the guest who has no\r\nplace at the table, Maxim doesn\u2019t let any other guest in the restaurant,\r\neven if one of the following guests in the queue would have fit in at\r\nthe table.Maxim is now wondering, what is the average number of visitors\r\nwho have come to the restaurant for all possible orders of guests in the\r\nqueue.
