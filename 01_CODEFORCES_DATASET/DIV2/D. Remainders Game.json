    "editorial": "Hint\nAssume the answer of a test is No. There must exist a pair of integers x1 and x2 such that both of them have the same remainders after dividing by any ci, but they differ in remainders after dividing by k. Find more facts about x1 and x2!\n\nSolution\nConsider the x1 and x2 from the hint part. We have x1?-?x2???0 () for each 1???i???n.\n\nSo:\n\n\nWe also have  (). As a result:\n\n\nWe've found a necessary condition. And I have to tell you it's also sufficient!\n\nAssume , we are going to prove there exists x1,?x2 such that x1?-?x2???0 () (for each 1???i???n), and  ().\n\nA possible solution is x1?=?lcm(c1,?c2,?...,?cn) and x2?=?2?Ã—?lcm(c1,?c2,?...,?cn), so the sufficiency is also proved.\n\nSo you have to check if lcm(c1,?c2,?...,?cn) is divisible by k, which could be done using prime factorization of k and ci values.\n\nFor each integer x smaller than MAXC, find it's greatest prime divisor gpdx using sieve of Eratosthenes in .\n\nThen using gpd array, you can write the value of each coin as p1q1p2q2...pmqm where pi is a prime integer and 1???qi holds. This could be done in  by moving from ci to  and adding gpdci to the answer. And you can factorize k by the same way. Now for every prime p that , see if there exists any coin i that the power of p in the factorization of ci is not smaller than the power of p in the factorization of k.",
