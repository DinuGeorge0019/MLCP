Roads (both vertical and horizontal) are numbered from to\r\n, and the intersections are indicated by the numbers of the roads that\r\nform them.Sand roads have long been recognized out of date, so the\r\ndecision was made to asphalt them. To do this, a team of workers was\r\nhired and a schedule of work was made, according to which the\r\nintersections should be asphalted.Road repairs are planned for days. On\r\nthe -th day of the team arrives at the -th intersection in the list and\r\nif of the two roads that form the intersection were already asphalted\r\nthey asphalt both roads. Otherwise, the team leaves the intersection,\r\nwithout doing anything with the roads.According to the schedule of road\r\nworks tell in which days at least one road will be asphalted.\r\n",

Then process intersections one by one from 1 to n, and if for i-th intersections both hused[hi] and vused[vi] are false, add i to answer and set both hused[hi] and vused[vi] with true meaning that hi-th horizontal and vi-th vertical roads are now asphalted, and skip asphalting the intersection roads otherwise."
