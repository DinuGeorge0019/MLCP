Hit Ball", "statement": "When Valera was playing football on a stadium, it suddenly began to\r\nrain. Valera hid in the corridor under the grandstand not to get wet.\r\nHowever, the desire to play was so great that he decided to train his\r\nhitting the ball right in this corridor. Valera went back far enough,\r\nput the ball and hit it. The ball bounced off the walls, the ceiling and\r\nthe floor corridor and finally hit the exit door. As the ball was wet,\r\nit left a spot on the door. Now Valera wants to know the coordinates for\r\nthis spot.Let\u2019s describe the event more formally. The ball will be\r\nconsidered a point in space. The door of the corridor will be considered\r\na rectangle located on plane , such that the lower left corner of the\r\ndoor is located at point , and the upper right corner is located at\r\npoint . The corridor will be considered as a rectangular parallelepiped,\r\ninfinite in the direction of increasing coordinates of . In this\r\ncorridor the floor will be considered as plane , and the ceiling as\r\nplane, parallel to and passing through point . We will also assume that\r\none of the walls is plane , and the other wall is plane, parallel to and\r\npassing through point .We\u2019ll say that the ball hit the door when its\r\ncoordinate was equal to . Thus the coordinates of the spot are point ,\r\nwhere . To hit the ball, Valera steps away from the door at distance and\r\nputs the ball in the center of the corridor at point . After the hit the\r\nball flies at speed . This means that if the ball has coordinates , then\r\nafter one second it will have coordinates .See image in notes for\r\nclarification.When the ball collides with the ceiling, the floor or a\r\nwall of the corridor, it bounces off in accordance with the laws of\r\nreflection (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). In\r\nthe problem we consider the ideal physical model, so we can assume that\r\nthere is no air resistance, friction force, or any loss of energy.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<iostream>\n#include<fstream>\n#include<cstdio>\n#include<cstdlib>\n#include<cstring>\n#include<algorithm>\n#include<iomanip>\n#include<string>\n#include<vector>\n#include<map>\n#include<queue>\n#include<ctime>\nusing namespace std;\n\ndouble x,y,z;\ndouble vx,vy,vz; \n\nint main()\n{\n\tcin>>x>>z>>y;\n\tcin>>vx>>vy>>vz;\n\tdouble t=-y/vy;\n\tdouble px,pz;\n\tpx=vx*t+x/2;\n\tpz=vz*t;\n\twhile(px<0) px+=x*2;\n\twhile(px>=x*2) px-=x*2;\n\twhile(pz<0) pz+=z*2;\n\twhile(pz>=z*2) pz-=z*2;\n\tif(px>x) px=x+x-px;\n\tif(pz>z) pz=z+z-pz;\n\tcout<<setiosflags(ios::fixed)<<setprecision(10)<<px<<' '<<pz<<endl;\n\t\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}\n/*\n7 2 11\n3 -11 2\n*/\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["geometry", "implementation", "math"], "dificulty": "1700", "interactive": false}
