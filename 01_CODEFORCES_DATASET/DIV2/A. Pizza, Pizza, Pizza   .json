Exactly n of Shiro\u2019s friends are here. That\u2019s\r\nwhy she has to divide the pizza into n + 1 slices (Shiro also needs to\r\neat). She wants the slices to be exactly the same size and shape. If\r\nnot, some of her friends will get mad and go home early, and the party\r\nwill be over.Shiro is now hungry. She wants to cut the pizza with of\r\nstraight cuts. A cut is a straight segment, it might have ends inside or\r\noutside the pizza. But she is too lazy to pick up the calculator.As\r\nusual, she will ask Katie and Kuro for help.
