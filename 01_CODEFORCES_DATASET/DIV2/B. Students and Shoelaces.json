They\u2019ve brought\r\nlots of shoe laces to the club and got tied with each other.\r\nSpecifically, each string ties together two students. Besides, if two\r\nstudents are tied, then the lace connects the first student with the\r\nsecond one as well as the second student with the first one.To restore\r\norder, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna\r\nfinds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to\r\nexactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a\r\nsingle group the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them\r\nout from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club.\r\nThese students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then\r\nagain for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is\r\ntied to and so on. And they do so until Anna can reprimand at least one\r\nstudent.Determine how many groups of students will be kicked out of the\r\nclub.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cstdio>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <utility>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <map>\n#include <queue>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <set>\n#include <iterator>\n\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\ntypedef pair< int, int > PRII;\ntypedef pair< double, double > PRDD;\ntypedef vector< string > VS;\ntypedef vector< int > VI;\n\n#define x first\n#define y second\n#define p_b push_back\n#define m_p make_pair\n#define oo 1000000000\n\n#define sqr(x) ((x)*(x))\n#define Size(a) ((int)a.size())\n#define forn(i,n) for( i = 0 ; i < n ; ++i )\n\nconst double pi = acos(-1);\n\n#define maxn 100 + 10\n\nint a[maxn],c[maxn][maxn];\nbool hash[maxn] = {0};\n\nint main()\n{\n    int n,m,ans = 0;\n    int i,j,k,t,u,v;\n    \n    scanf(\"%d%d\",&n,&m);\n    for( i = 1 ; i <= m ; ++i )\n        {\n            scanf(\"%d%d\",&u,&v);\n            c[u][v] = c[v][u] = 1;\n        }\n    \n    while(1)\n        {\n            k = 0;\n            for( i = 1 ; i <= n ; ++i )\n                if( !hash[i] )\n                    {\n                        t = 0;\n                        for( j = 1 ; j <= n ; ++j )\n                            if( !hash[j] && c[i][j] )\n                                ++t;\n                        if( t == 1 )\n                            a[++k] = i;\n                    }\n            for( i = 1 ; i <= k ; ++i )\n                hash[a[i]] = 1;\n            if( !k )\n                break;\n            ++ans;\n        }\n    \n    printf(\"%d\\n\",ans);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "graphs", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
