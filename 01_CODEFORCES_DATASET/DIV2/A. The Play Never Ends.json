They\r\ndecided to play forever in the following way: In each match, two players\r\ncompete while the third spectates. To ensure fairness, no player can\r\nplay three times in a row. The player who plays twice in a row must sit\r\nout as a spectator in the next match, which will be played by the other\r\ntwo players. Otherwise, the winner and the spectator will play in the\r\nnext match, while the loser will spectate. Now, the players, fully\r\nimmersed in this infinite loop of matches, have tasked you with solving\r\nthe following problem:Given an integer k, determine whether the\r\nspectator of the first match can be the spectator in the k-th match.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math", "number theory"], "dificulty": "800", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV2\\A.
