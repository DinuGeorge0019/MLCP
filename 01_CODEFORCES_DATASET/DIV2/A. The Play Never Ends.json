    "editorial": "SolutionOnce the winner of the first match is decided, the rest of the\r\ngame is completely predictable.For example, if Hohai wins the first\r\nmatch which Fofo spectated, we can see that: No matter who wins in the\r\nsecond match, Hohai won’t be able to continue playing in the third match\r\n(even if he wins the second match) since he has already played two times\r\nin a row. Similarly, Fofo won’t be able to play in the fourth match\r\nbecause he has already played twice in a row, regardless of the match\r\nresult.As a result, Fofo won’t be able to spectate in the -th match for\r\nany of the form .The overall time complexity is: .\r\n",

    "statement": "Let’s introduce a two-player game, table tennis, where a winner is\r\nalways decided and draws are impossible.Three players, Sosai, Fofo, and\r\nHohai, want to spend the rest of their lives playing table tennis. They\r\ndecided to play forever in the following way: In each match, two players\r\ncompete while the third spectates. To ensure fairness, no player can\r\nplay three times in a row. The player who plays twice in a row must sit\r\nout as a spectator in the next match, which will be played by the other\r\ntwo players. Otherwise, the winner and the spectator will play in the\r\nnext match, while the loser will spectate. Now, the players, fully\r\nimmersed in this infinite loop of matches, have tasked you with solving\r\nthe following problem:Given an integer k, determine whether the\r\nspectator of the first match can be the spectator in the k-th match.\r\n",
