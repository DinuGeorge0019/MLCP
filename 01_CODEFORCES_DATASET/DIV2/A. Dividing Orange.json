    "statement": "One day Ms Swan bought an orange in a shop. The orange consisted of\r\nsegments, numbered with integers from 1 to . There were children waiting\r\nfor Ms Swan at home. The children have recently learned about the orange\r\nand they decided to divide it between them. For that each child took a\r\npiece of paper and wrote the number of the segment that he would like to\r\nget: the -th child wrote the number . All numbers accidentally turned\r\nout to be different.Now the children wonder, how to divide the orange so\r\nas to meet these conditions: each child gets exactly orange segments;\r\nthe -th child gets the segment with number for sure; no segment goes to\r\ntwo children simultaneously. Help the children, divide the orange and\r\nfulfill the requirements, described above.\r\n",
