Alice immediately took an orange for\r\nherself, Bob took an apple. To make the process of sharing the remaining\r\nfruit more fun, the friends decided to play a game. They put multiple\r\ncards and on each one they wrote a letter, either \u201d, or the letter \u201d.\r\nThen they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every\r\ntime they removed a card with the letter \u201d, Alice gave Bob all the\r\nfruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and\r\nas many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and apples\r\nAlice had, did not change. If the card had written letter \u201d, then Bob\r\ndid the same, that is, he gave Alice all the fruit that he had, and took\r\nfrom the bag the same set of fruit. After the last card way removed, all\r\nthe fruit in the bag were over.You know how many oranges and apples was\r\nin the bag at first. Your task is to find any sequence of cards that\r\nAlice and Bob could have played with.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cstdio>\n#include <algorithm>\n\n#ifdef WIN32\n\t#define LL \"%I64d\"\n#else\n\t#define LL \"%lld\"\n#endif\n\nconst char s[] = \"AB\";\n\nlong long x, y;\n\nlong long gcd(long long a, long long b) {\n\treturn b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a;\n}\n\nvoid gcd(long long x, long long y, char a, char b) {\n\twhile (!(x == 1 && y == 1)) {\n\t\tif (x < y) {\n\t\t\tstd::swap(x, y);\n\t\t\tstd::swap(a, b);\n\t\t}\n\t\tprintf(LL \"%c\", (x - 1) / y, a);\n\t\tlong long ox = x, oy = y;\n\t\tx = ox - (ox - 1) / oy * oy;\n\t\ty = oy;\n\t}\n}\n\nint main() {\n\tscanf(LL LL, &x, &y);\n\tif (gcd(x, y) != 1ll) return puts(\"Impossible\"), 0;\n\telse{\n\t\tgcd(x, y, 'A', 'B');\n\t\tputs(\"\");\n\t}\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["number theory"], "dificulty": "2400", "interactive": false}
