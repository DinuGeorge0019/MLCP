For instance, he learned that the\r\nRussian word \"tma\" (which now means \"too much to be counted\") used to\r\nstand for a thousand and \"tma tmyschaya\" (which literally means \"the tma\r\nof tmas\") used to stand for a million.Petya wanted to modernize the\r\nwords we use for numbers and invented a word that represents number .\r\nMoreover, stands for number , stands for and so on. All numbers of this\r\nform are called , and the number’s importance is the number of articles\r\nin its title.Petya’s invention brought on a challenge that needed to be\r\nsolved quickly: does some number belong to the set ? As Petya is a very\r\nbusy schoolboy he needs to automate the process, he asked you to solve\r\nit.\r\n",

    "editorial": "To solve this task, let's describe what is needed more formally. We should answer whether is number l some positive degree of number k or no. To answer this question we can proceed in 2 ways:\n1) Using 64 bit data type, we can find minimal degree h of number k, such that kh???l. If kh?=?l, then the answer is YES, and number of articles is equal to h?-?1. Otherwise, the answer is NO.\n2) We will divide l by k, until k divides l and l???1. If l?=?1, then the answer - YES and number of articles is equal to numberOfDivisions?-?1, and the answer is NO otherwise.",
