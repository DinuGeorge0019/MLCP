Peter\u2019s\r\nstrict parents made him prepare for the exam immediately, for this\r\npurpose he has to study not less than and not more than hours per each\r\n-th day. Moreover, they warned Peter that a day before the exam they\r\nwould check how he has followed their instructions.So, today is the day\r\nwhen Peter\u2019s parents ask him to show the timetable of his preparatory\r\nstudies. But the boy has counted only the sum of hours spent him on\r\npreparation, and now he wants to know if he can show his parents a\r\ntimetable with numbers, where each number stands for the time in hours\r\nspent by Peter each -th day on biology studies, and satisfying the\r\nlimitations imposed by his parents, and at the same time the sum total\r\nof all should equal to .\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <math.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <vector>\n#include <map>\n#include <string>\n#include <set>\n#include <sstream>\n\n#define FOR(i,a,b) for(int i = a; i <= b; i++) \n#define DOWN(i,a,b) for(int i = a; i >= b; i--)\n#define FORV(i,a) for(typeof(a.begin()) i = a.begin(); i != a.end(); i++)\n#define FR(i,a) for(int i = 0; i < a; i++)\n#define REP(i,a) for(int i = 0; i < a; i++)\n#define Rep(i,a) for(int i = 0; i < a; i++)\n#define For(i,a,b) for(int i = a; i <= b; i++)\n\n#define sqr(x) (x)*(x)\n#define dout debug && cout \n#define next(i,n) ((i == n) ? 1 : i + 1)   //1..n\n#define prev(i,n) ((i == 1) ? n : i - 1)   //1..n\n#define ll long long\n#define ull unsigned long long\n/* CONSTANT  */\n#define oo 1000000002\n/* DEBUGGING */\nbool debug = false;\n/* MAIN PROGRAM */\n\nusing namespace std;\nint n,M,sum = 0,minTime[100],maxTime[100];\nint main()\n{ \n//    freopen(\"test.in\",\"r\",stdin);\n//    freopen(\"test.out\",\"w\",stdout);\n    cin >> n >> M;\n    FOR(i,1,n)\n    {\n        scanf(\"%d%d\",&minTime[i],&maxTime[i]);\n        maxTime[i] -= minTime[i];\n        M -= minTime[i];\n        sum += maxTime[i];\n    }\n    if (M < 0)\n    {\n        cout << \"NO\";\n        return 0;\n    }\n    if (sum < M)\n    {\n        cout << \"NO\";\n        return 0;\n    }\n    cout << \"YES\" << endl;    \n    FOR(i,1,n)\n    {\n        if (maxTime[i] <= M)\n        {\n            M -= maxTime[i];\n            cout << maxTime[i] + minTime[i] << \" \";\n        } else\n        {\n            cout << minTime[i] + M << \" \";\n            M = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "greedy"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
