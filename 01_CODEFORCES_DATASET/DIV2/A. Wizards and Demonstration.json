They want to organize a\r\ndemonstration.There are people living in the city, of them are the\r\nwizards who will surely go to the demonstration. Other city people (\r\npeople) do not support the wizards and aren\u2019t going to go to the\r\ndemonstration. We know that the city administration will react only to\r\nthe demonstration involving at least percent of the city people. Having\r\nconsidered the matter, the wizards decided to create clone puppets which\r\ncan substitute the city people on the demonstration. So all in all, the\r\ndemonstration will involve only the wizards and their puppets. The city\r\nadministration cannot tell the difference between a puppet and a person,\r\nso, as they calculate the percentage, the administration will consider\r\nthe city to be consisting of only people and not containing any clone\r\npuppets. Help the wizards and find the minimum number of clones to\r\ncreate to that the demonstration had no less than percent of the city\r\npeople.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<iostream>\n#include<cstdio>\n#include<cmath>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tdouble P;\n\tint N,wizard;\n\tscanf(\"%d %d %lf\",&N,&wizard,&P);\n\tint jawab = max(0,(int)(ceil(P/100.0*(double)N)+0.005) - wizard);\n\tprintf(\"%d\\n\",jawab);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation", "math"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
