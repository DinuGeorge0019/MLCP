    "statement": "Dima loves watching soccer. In such a game, the score on the scoreboard\r\nis represented as x : y, where x is the number of goals of the first\r\nteam, and y is the number of goals of the second team. At any given\r\ntime, only one team can score a goal, so the score x : y can change to\r\neither (x + 1) : y, or x : (y + 1).While watching a soccer game, Dima\r\nwas distracted by very important matters, and after some time, he\r\nreturned to watching the game. Dima remembers the score right before he\r\nwas distracted, and the score right after he returned. Given these two\r\nscores, he wonders the following question. Is it possible that, , the\r\nteams never had an equal score?It is guaranteed that at neither of the\r\ntwo time points Dima remembers the teams had equal scores. However, it\r\nis possible that the score did not change during his absence.Help Dima\r\nand answer the question!\r\n",
