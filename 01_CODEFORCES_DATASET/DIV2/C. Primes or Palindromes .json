It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a\r\nnumber of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific\r\ncommunity in this!Let us remind you that a number is called if it is\r\ninteger larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer\r\nother than itself and one.Rikhail calls a number a if it is integer,\r\npositive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a\r\npalindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.One\r\nproblem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let\u2019s\r\nintroduce the following notation: the number of primes no larger than ,\r\nthe number of palindromic numbers no larger than .

Moreover, for this answer n the next condition hold: . In our case n?<?107.\n\nFor all numbers smaller than 107 we can check if they are primes (via sieve of Eratosthenes) and/or palindromes (via trivial algorithm or compute reverse number via dynamic approach). Then we can calculate prefix sums (?(n) and rub(n)) and find the answer using linear search.\n\nFor A???42 answer is smaller than 2\u00b7106."
