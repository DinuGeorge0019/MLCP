Bicycle Chain", "statement": "Vasya\u2019s bicycle chain drive consists of two parts: stars are attached to\r\nthe pedal axle, stars are attached to the rear wheel axle. The chain\r\nhelps to rotate the rear wheel by transmitting the pedal rotation.We\r\nknow that the -th star on the pedal axle has teeth, and the -th star on\r\nthe rear wheel axle has teeth. Any pair ; is called a and sets the\r\nindexes of stars to which the chain is currently attached. Gear has a\r\ngear ratio, equal to the value .Since Vasya likes integers, he wants to\r\nfind such gears , that their ratios are integers. On the other hand,\r\nVasya likes fast driving, so among all \"integer\" gears he wants to\r\nchoose a gear with the maximum ratio. Help him to find the number of\r\nsuch gears.In the problem, fraction denotes division in real numbers,\r\nthat is, no rounding is performed.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<cstdio>\n#include<cstring>\n#include<algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\nint n,m,a[100],b[100];\nint main()\n{\n    while(~scanf(\"%d\",&n))\n    {\n        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\n        scanf(\"%d\",&a[i]);\n        scanf(\"%d\",&m);\n        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++)\n        scanf(\"%d\",&b[i]);\n        int ma=0;\n        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\n        for(int j=1;j<=m;j++)\n        if(b[j]%a[i]==0)\n        {\n            ma=max(ma,b[j]/a[i]);\n        }\n        int ans=0;\n        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\n        for(int j=1;j<=m;j++)\n        if(b[j]%a[i]==0&&b[j]/a[i]==ma)ans++;\n        printf(\"%d\\n\",ans);\n    }\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "implementation"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
