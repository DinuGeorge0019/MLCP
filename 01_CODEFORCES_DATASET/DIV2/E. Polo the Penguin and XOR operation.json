    "editorial": "Solution. Since we need to maximize the result, we need to find such permutation, for which the least number of bit disappear. (We consider bit disappeared if it was 1 both in i and pi, so in  it is 0). It turns out that for each n there is such permutation that no bit disappear. How to build it? We will be solving problem by iterations while n?>?0. On each iteration, we need to find the biggest (the leftmost in binary representation) bit which is not 0 in binary representation of n and denote it position (bits are numbered from 0) by b. Now we need to find integer m Â— minimal integer from 0 to n, inclusive, such that b-th bit is also 1 in it. After that you can see (look image below), that at  no bit disappear, at  no bit disappear, ..., at  no bit disappear. So, it is good to assign exactly that integers to our permutation, i. e. pm?=?m?-?1 and pm?-?1?=?m, pm?+?1?=?m?-?2 and pm?-?2?=?m?+?1 and so on. After that assign value m?-?(n?-?m?+?1)?-?1 to n and go to next iteration.\n\n \n\nNow when we know how to build permutation and that no bit disappear, the value of the answer is equal to .",
