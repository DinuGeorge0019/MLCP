    "editorial": "Consider permutation p such that pi?=?i. Actually p is a sequence of numbers from 1 to n. Obviously ppi?=?i. Now the only trick is to change the permutation to satisfy the second equation: pi???i. Let's swap every two consequtive elements. More formally, for each k:?2k???n let's swap p2k?-?1 and p2k. It's easy to see that the obtained permutation satisfies both equations for every n with the only exception: when n is odd, there is no answer and we should print ?-?1."
