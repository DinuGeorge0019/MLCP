    "statement": "A girl named Xenia has a cupboard that looks like an arc from ahead. The\r\narc is made of a semicircle with radius (the cupboard’s top) and two\r\nwalls of height (the cupboard’s sides). The cupboard’s depth is , that\r\nis, it looks like a rectangle with base and height from the sides. The\r\nfigure below shows what the cupboard looks like (the front view is on\r\nthe left, the side view is on the right). Xenia got lots of balloons for\r\nher birthday. The girl hates the mess, so she wants to store the\r\nballoons in the cupboard. Luckily, each balloon is a sphere with radius\r\n. Help Xenia calculate the maximum number of balloons she can put in her\r\ncupboard. You can say that a balloon is in the cupboard if you can’t see\r\nany part of the balloon on the left or right view. The balloons in the\r\ncupboard can touch each other. It is not allowed to squeeze the balloons\r\nor deform them in any way. You can assume that the cupboard’s walls are\r\nnegligibly thin.\r\n",

The most difficulties were to deal with this last phase. In\r\ncomments to the post were given formulas how to put the last marble\r\n(exactly in the middle). And there was a good beautiful illustration,\r\nwhich describes the situation.\r\n",
