On each wire there are some oskols sitting next to each other.\r\nOskol is the name of a delicious kind of birds in Shaass\u2019s territory.\r\nSupposed there are oskols sitting on the -th wire. Sometimes Shaass\r\nshots one of the birds and the bird dies (suppose that this bird sat at\r\nthe -th wire). Consequently all the birds on the -th wire to the left of\r\nthe dead bird get scared and jump up on the wire number , if there\r\nexists no upper wire they fly away. Also all the birds to the right of\r\nthe dead bird jump down on wire number , if there exists no such wire\r\nthey fly away. Shaass has shot birds. You\u2019re given the initial number of\r\nbirds on each wire, tell him how many birds are sitting on each wire\r\nafter the shots.\r\n",

    "editorial": "Although Oskol is not really name of a specie of birds, In Iran it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\r\nknown as a kind of bird which is very forgetful and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even remember\r\nhis way back to home when he flies away! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commonly used instead of\r\nthe word \"stupid\" among the kids! :D In this problem you just have to\r\nnow how many birds are there on each wire after each shot. A good trick\r\nfor the first and the last wire would be to define wires and . In this\r\nway the birds that fly away sit on these wires and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to\r\nworry about accessing some element outside the range of your array. Here\r\nis a neat implementation in C++ from contestant rpslive: 3484601\r\n"
