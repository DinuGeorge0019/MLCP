Initially, all the cards lay on the table with the front\r\nside up. In one move the Little Elephant can turn any card to the other\r\nside. The Little Elephant thinks that a set of cards on the table is\r\nfunny if at least half of the cards have the same color (for each card\r\nthe color of the upper side is considered).Help the Little Elephant to\r\nfind the minimum number of moves needed to make the set of cards funny.\r\n",

    "editorial": "It is nice to use the structure in this problem, but you can solve it\r\nwithout (using sorting and binary serach). Lets iterate through all\r\npossible colors that we have and suppose that this currect color is the\r\none that will make our set funny. The minimal number through all this\r\nwill be the answer. To find the minimal number of turns to make our set\r\nfunny using current color we need to know two numbers: the number of\r\ncards with current color on the front side and the number of cards with\r\nthe current color on back side (but not at the same time). Let it be\r\nintegers and . Let the minimal number of the same cards required to get\r\nthe funny set. Then if it is impossible to make set funny using current\r\ncolor at all. If then the answer is , otherwise the answer is .\r\n",
