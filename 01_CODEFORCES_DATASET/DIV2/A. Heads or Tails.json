If the tossing player gets head, he scores\r\none point. If he gets tail, nobody gets any points. The winner is the\r\nplayer with most points by the end of the game. If boys have the same\r\nnumber of points, the game finishes with a draw.At some point, Valera\r\nlost his count, and so he can not say exactly what the score is at the\r\nend of the game. But there are things he remembers for sure. He\r\nremembers that the entire game Vasya got heads at least times, and Petya\r\ngot heads at least times. Moreover, he knows that the winner of the game\r\nwas Vasya. Valera wants to use this information to know every possible\r\noutcome of the game, which do not contradict his memories.\r\n",
