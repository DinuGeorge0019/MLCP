    "editorial": "SolutionWhile a player who goes to HP will lose the game outright, when\r\na player’s knight dies, she loses the ability to attack; then in future\r\nrounds, she can only be attacked by her opponent and thus lose the\r\ngame.Thus it can be found that the player herself is as important as her\r\nknights, and she loses the game when either of them becomes\r\nHP.Therefore, the optimal strategy for both of them is to attack the one\r\nwith lower HP. So when is greater than or equal to , Gellyfish wins,\r\notherwise Flower wins.Time complexity: per test case.Memory complexity:\r\nper test case.\r\n",

    "statement": "Gellyfish and Flower are playing a game called \"Duel\".Gellyfish has a\r\nHP, while Flower has b HP.Each of them has a knight. Gellyfish’s knight\r\nhas c HP, while Flower’s knight has d HP.They will play a game in rounds\r\nuntil one of the players wins. For k = 1, 2,\r\nldots in this order, they will perform the following actions: If k is\r\nodd and Gellyfish’s knight is alive: Gellyfish’s knight can attack\r\nFlower and reduce b by 1. If b\r\nleq 0, . Or, Gellyfish’s knight can attack Flower’s knight and reduce d\r\nby 1. If d\r\nleq 0, Flower’s knight dies. If k is even and Flower’s knight is alive:\r\nFlower’s knight can attack Gellyfish and reduce a by 1. If a\r\nleq 0, . Or, Flower’s knight can attack Gellyfish’s knight and reduce c\r\nby 1. If c\r\nleq 0, Gellyfish’s knight dies. As one of the smartest people in the\r\nworld, you want to tell them who will win before the game. Assume both\r\nplayers play optimally.It can be proven that the game will never end in\r\na draw. That is, one player has a strategy to end the game in a finite\r\nnumber of moves.\r\n",
