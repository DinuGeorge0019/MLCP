Your garden is\r\ndescribed by an grid, with rows numbered to from top to bottom, and\r\ncolumns to from left to right. Each cell is identified by a pair which\r\nmeans that the cell is located at row and column . Each cell may contain\r\neither grass or weeds. For example, a garden may look as follows (empty\r\ncells denote grass): You have a land-mower with you to mow all the\r\nweeds. Initially, you are standing with your lawnmower at the top-left\r\ncorner of the garden. That is, at cell . At any moment of time you are\r\nfacing a certain direction either left or right. And initially, you face\r\nright.In one move you can do either one of these:1) Move one cell in the\r\ndirection that you are facing. if you are facing right: move from cell\r\nto cell if you are facing left: move from cell to cell 2) Move one cell\r\ndown (that is, from cell to cell ), and change your direction to the\r\nopposite one. if you were facing right previously, you will face left if\r\nyou were facing left previously, you will face right You are not allowed\r\nto leave the garden. Weeds will be mowed if you and your lawnmower are\r\nstanding at the cell containing the weeds (your direction doesn\u2019t\r\nmatter).
