    "statement": "A renowned abstract artist Sasha, drawing inspiration from nowhere,\r\ndecided to paint a picture entitled \"Special Olympics\". He justly\r\nthought that, if the regular Olympic games have five rings, then the\r\nSpecial ones will do with exactly two rings just fine.Let us remind you\r\nthat a ring is a region located between two concentric circles with\r\nradii and . These radii are called internal and external, respectively.\r\nConcentric circles are circles with centers located at the same\r\npoint.Soon a white canvas, which can be considered as an infinite\r\nCartesian plane, had two perfect rings, painted with solid black paint.\r\nAs Sasha is very impulsive, the rings could have different radii and\r\nsizes, they intersect and overlap with each other in any way. We know\r\nonly one thing for sure: the centers of the pair of rings are not the\r\nsame.When Sasha got tired and fell into a deep sleep, a girl called\r\nIlona came into the room and wanted to cut a circle for the sake of good\r\nmemories. To make the circle beautiful, she decided to cut along the\r\ncontour.We’ll consider a contour to be a continuous closed line through\r\nwhich there is transition from one color to another (see notes for\r\nclarification). If the contour takes the form of a circle, then the\r\nresult will be cutting out a circle, which Iona wants.But the girl’s\r\ninquisitive mathematical mind does not rest: how many ways are there to\r\ncut a circle out of the canvas?\r\n",

    "editorial": "You should check for every circle of one ring: it have intersections with another ring or not. So, there are 4 checks.\n\nThere are 2 cases:\n1. circle is inside of ring;\n2. circle is outside of ring and ring is outside of circle;\n3. circle is outside of ring and ring is inside of circle.\nIf at least one of these cases is performed, circle is good.\n\nYou can easily do checks following way. Let us d be a distance between centers of ring and circle, r1 and R1 are inside and outside radii of ring, r be radius of circle. Then conditions for all cases will be\n1. d?+?r???r1.\n2. r?+?R1???d.\n3. d?+?R1???r.\nYou can check all conditions in integers using squares of distances.",
