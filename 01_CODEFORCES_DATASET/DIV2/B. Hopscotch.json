    "statement": "So nearly half of the winter is over and Maria is dreaming about summer.\r\nShe\u2019s fed up with skates and sleds, she was dreaming about Hopscotch all\r\nnight long. It\u2019s a very popular children\u2019s game. The game field, the\r\ncourt, looks as is shown in the figure (all blocks are square and are\r\nnumbered from bottom to top, blocks in the same row are numbered from\r\nleft to right). Let us describe the hopscotch with numbers that denote\r\nthe number of squares in the row, staring from the lowest one:\r\n1-1-2-1-2-1-2-(1-2)..., where then the period is repeated (1-2). The\r\ncoordinate system is defined as shown in the figure. Side of all the\r\nsquares are equal and have length .Maria is a very smart and clever\r\ngirl, and she is concerned with quite serious issues: if she throws a\r\nstone into a point with coordinates , then will she hit some square? If\r\nthe answer is positive, you are also required to determine the number of\r\nthe square.It is believed that the stone has fallen into the square if\r\nit is located inside it. In other words a stone that has fallen on the\r\nsquare border is not considered a to hit a square.\r\n",

Then we can understand, how many squares there are on this level: one or two. Then we check with one or two ifs (if on this level two squares) if the stone is in corresponding square or not. If the stone is inside then output the answer. If we didn't find any square, where the stone is, output \"-1\".  "
