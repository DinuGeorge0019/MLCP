We will assume that the Olympiads are numbered with\r\nconsecutive integers from 1 to . For each Olympiad we know how many\r\nmembers of the jury must be involved in its preparation, as well as the\r\ntime required to prepare the problems for her. Namely, the Olympiad\r\nnumber should be prepared by people for days, the preparation for the\r\nOlympiad should be a continuous period of time and end exactly one day\r\nbefore the Olympiad. On the day of the Olympiad the juries who have\r\nprepared it, already do not work on it.For example, if the Olympiad is\r\nheld on December 9th and the preparation takes 7 people and 6 days, all\r\nseven members of the jury will work on the problems of the Olympiad from\r\nDecember, 3rd to December, 8th (the jury members won\u2019t be working on the\r\nproblems of this Olympiad on December 9th, that is, some of them can\r\nstart preparing problems for some other Olympiad). And if the Olympiad\r\nis held on November 3rd and requires 5 days of training, the members of\r\nthe jury will work from October 29th to November 2nd.In order not to\r\noverload the jury the following rule was introduced: one member of the\r\njury can not work on the same day on the tasks for different Olympiads.\r\nWrite a program that determines what the minimum number of people must\r\nbe part of the jury so that all Olympiads could be prepared in time.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<cstdio>\n#include<cstring>\nusing namespace std;\nint a[1000];\nint mon[13];\nconst int dt = 366;\nint main()\n{\n\tint n;\n\tfreopen( \"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n\tfreopen( \"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n\tmon[0] = 0;\n\tmon[1] = 31;\n\tmon[2] = 31 + 28;\n\tmon[3] = mon[2] + 31;\n\tmon[4] = mon[3] + 30;\n\tmon[5] = mon[4] + 31;\n\tmon[6] = mon[5] + 30;\n\tmon[7] = mon[6] + 31;\n\tmon[8] = mon[7] + 31;\n\tmon[9] = mon[8] + 30;\n\tmon[10] = mon[9] + 31;\n\tmon[11] = mon[10] + 30;\n\tmon[12] = mon[11] + 31;\n\tscanf( \"%d\", &n );\n\tfor ( int i = 0; i < n; i++ )\n\t{\n\t\tint m,d,r,t,l;\n\t\tscanf( \"%d%d%d%d\", &m, &d, &r, &t );\n\t\t\tl = mon[m - 1] + d - t;\n\t\t\tfor ( int j = 0; j < t; j++ )\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\ta[l+dt+j]+=r;\n//\t\t\t\tprintf( \"%d\\n\", l+dt+j );\n\t\t\t}\n\t}\n\tint m = 0;\n\tfor ( int i = 0; i < 800; i++ )\n\tif ( a[i] > m ) m = a[i];\n\tprintf( \"%d\\n\", m );\n\treturn 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1500", "interactive": false}
