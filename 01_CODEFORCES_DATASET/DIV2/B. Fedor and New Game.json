Players Call of\r\nSoldiers 3 are numbered form to . Types of soldiers are numbered from to\r\n. Each player has an army. Army of the -th player can be described by\r\nnon-negative integer . Consider binary representation of : if the -th\r\nbit of number equal to one, then the army of the -th player has soldiers\r\nof the -th type. Fedor is the -th player of the game. He assume that two\r\nplayers can become friends if their armies differ in at most types of\r\nsoldiers (in other words, binary representations of the corresponding\r\nnumbers differ in at most bits). Help Fedor and count how many players\r\ncan become his friends.\r\n",
