There are 4 types of tickets: A\r\nticket for one ride on some bus or trolley. It costs burles; A ticket\r\nfor an unlimited number of rides on some bus or on some trolley. It\r\ncosts burles; A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses or\r\nall trolleys. It costs burles; A ticket for an unlimited number of rides\r\non all buses and trolleys. It costs burles. Vasya knows for sure the\r\nnumber of rides he is going to make and the transport he is going to\r\nuse. He asked you for help to find the minimum sum of burles he will\r\nhave to spend on the tickets.\r\n",

    "editorial": "If we buy a ticket of the fourth type, we donât have to buy anything\r\nelse, so, the answer is . Now, when we donât have ticket of the fourth\r\ntype, we can solve the task separately for buses and trolleys. Solving\r\nthe problem only for buses: if we buy a ticket of the third type, we\r\ndonât have to buy anything else, so, the answer is . Without tickets of\r\ntype three, we can solve the problem separately for each bus. If we buy\r\na ticket of the second type, we will spend burles and if we buy tickets\r\nof the first type, we will spend burles. So, the answer for bus is . Now\r\nit is not difficult to obtain the following solution: Time complexity: .\r\n",
