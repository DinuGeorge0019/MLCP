If the bone happens to be at\r\nthe position where there is a hole at any time, it will fall into the\r\nhole onto the ground and will not be affected by future swapping\r\noperations.Do not forget that Zane is a wizard. When he swaps the cups,\r\nhe does not move them ordinarily. Instead, he teleports the cups (along\r\nwith the bone, if it is inside) to the intended positions. Therefore,\r\nfor example, when he swaps the cup at and the one at , they will not be\r\nat the position at any moment during the operation. Zane s puppy,\r\nInzane, is in trouble. Zane is away on his vacation, and Inzane cannot\r\nfind his beloved bone, as it would be too exhausting to try opening all\r\nthe cups. Inzane knows that the Codeforces community has successfully\r\nhelped Zane, so he wants to see if it could help him solve his problem\r\ntoo.
