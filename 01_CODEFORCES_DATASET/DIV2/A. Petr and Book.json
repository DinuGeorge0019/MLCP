Some days are so busy that Petr will\r\nhave no time to read whatsoever. However, we know that he will be able\r\nto read at least one page a week.Assuming that Petr will not skip days\r\nand will read as much as he can every day, determine on which day of the\r\nweek he will read the last page of the book.\r\n",
