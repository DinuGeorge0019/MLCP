Cableway", "statement": "A group of university students wants to get to the top of a mountain to\r\nhave a picnic there. For that they decided to use a cableway.A cableway\r\nis represented by some cablecars, hanged onto some cable stations by a\r\ncable. A cable is scrolled cyclically between the first and the last\r\ncable stations (the first of them is located at the bottom of the\r\nmountain and the last one is located at the top). As the cable moves,\r\nthe cablecar attached to it move as well.The number of cablecars is\r\ndivisible by three and they are painted three colors: red, green and\r\nblue, in such manner that after each red cablecar goes a green one,\r\nafter each green cablecar goes a blue one and after each blue cablecar\r\ngoes a red one. Each cablecar can transport no more than two people, the\r\ncablecars arrive with the periodicity of one minute (i. e. every minute)\r\nand it takes exactly minutes for a cablecar to get to the top.All\r\nstudents are divided into three groups: of them like to ascend only in\r\nthe red cablecars, of them prefer only the green ones and of them prefer\r\nonly the blue ones. A student never gets on a cablecar painted a color\r\nthat he doesn\u2019t like,The first cablecar to arrive (at the moment of time\r\n) is painted red. Determine the least time it will take all students to\r\nascend to the mountain top.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <algorithm>\n#include <cctype>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <deque>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <map>\n#include <queue>\n#include <set>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <stack>\n#include <string>\n#include <utility>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define size(x) int((x).size())\n#define foreach(i,c) for(typeof((c).begin()) i=(c).begin();i!=(c).end();i++)\ntypedef long long I64; typedef unsigned long long U64;\nconst double EPS=1e-12;\nconst int INF=999999999;\ntypedef vector<int> VI;\ntypedef vector<string> VS;\n\nint a[3];\n\nint main() {\n  scanf(\"%d%d%d\",&a[0],&a[1],&a[2]);\n  for(int i=0;i<3;++i) a[i]=a[i]/2+(a[i]%2);\n\n  int res=0;\n  for(int i=0;;++i) {\n    if(a[0]+a[1]+a[2]==0) break;\n    int g=i%3;\n    if(a[g]>0) {\n      a[g]--;\n      res=max(res,i+30);\n    }\n  }\n  printf(\"%d\\n\",res);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "dificulty": "1000", "interactive": false}
