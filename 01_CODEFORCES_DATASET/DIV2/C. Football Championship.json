    "statement": "The Berland National team takes part in the local Football championship\r\nwhich now has a group stage. Let\u2019s describe the formal rules of the\r\nlocal championship: the team that kicked most balls in the enemy\u2019s goal\r\narea wins the game; the victory gives 3 point to the team, the draw\r\ngives 1 point and the defeat gives 0 points; a group consists of four\r\nteams, the teams are ranked by the results of six games: each team plays\r\nexactly once with each other team; the teams that get places 1 and 2 in\r\nthe group stage results, go to the next stage of the championship. In\r\nthe group stage the team\u2019s place is defined by the total number of\r\nscored points: the more points, the higher the place is. If two or more\r\nteams have the same number of points, then the following criteria are\r\nused (the criteria are listed in the order of falling priority, starting\r\nfrom the most important one): the difference between the total number of\r\nscored goals and the total number of missed goals in the championship:\r\nthe team with a higher value gets a higher place; the total number of\r\nscored goals in the championship: the team with a higher value gets a\r\nhigher place; the lexicographical order of the name of the teams\u2019\r\ncountries: the country with the lexicographically smaller name gets a\r\nhigher place. The Berland team plays in the group where the results of 5\r\nout of 6 games are already known. To be exact, there is the last game\r\nleft. There the Berand national team plays with some other team. The\r\ncoach asks you to find such score (where is the number of goals Berland\r\nscored and is the number of goals the opponent scored in the game), that\r\nfulfills the following conditions: > , that is, Berland is going to win\r\nthis game; after the game Berland gets the 1st or the 2nd place in the\r\ngroup; if there are multiple variants, you should choose such score ,\r\nwhere value is minimum; if it is still impossible to come up with one\r\nscore, you should choose the score where value (the number of goals\r\nBerland misses) is minimum.\r\n",

There were given results of all\r\nmatches, excepting one, and you had to find result of the last match,\r\nsatisfied some given criterias. Also Berland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team must be first or the\r\nsecond team of the group after than match. Lets note, that in each\r\nfinished match were not greater than 18 goals. It means that we can\r\nbrute-force all results of the last match, when score is not greater\r\nthan 200 goals, and find the best one. One of the easiest way is to fill\r\ntable to the end (it means to change points value and balls value), than\r\nto sort teams according to the given rules and to check that Berland is\r\nthe first or the second team of the group.\r\n"
