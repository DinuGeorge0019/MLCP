And she has found one!Why not\r\nmake her own Codeforces, with blackjack and other really cool stuff?\r\nMany people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high\r\nculture.In Mainframe a standard pack of cards is used to play blackjack.\r\nThe pack contains cards of values: , , , , , , , , , jacks, queens,\r\nkings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts,\r\ndiamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points\r\nassigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from to points,\r\ncorrespondingly. An ace can either earn or , whatever the player wishes.\r\nThe picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn points. The number of\r\npoints a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game\r\nare very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of\r\nthose cards equals , then the player wins, otherwise the player\r\nloses.The player has already got the first card, it\u2019s the queen of\r\nspades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many\r\nways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly\r\nequals .\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    int n,ans;\n    while(scanf(\"%d\",&n)==1)\n    {\n        n-=10;\n        if (n<1) ans=0; else\n        //if (n==1) ans=8; else\n        if (n==10) ans=15; else\n        if (n<=11) ans=4; else\n        ans=0;\n        printf(\"%d\\n\",ans);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "800", "interactive": false}
