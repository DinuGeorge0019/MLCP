Help him to choose the bus stop,\r\nwhere he should get off. If such bus stops are multiple, choose the bus\r\nstop closest to the University.\r\n",

    "editorial": "It is simple to calculate the time ti that the Student will need, if he gets off the bus at the i-th stop: ti?=?bi?+?si, where bi?=?xi?/?vb is the time he will drive on the bus, and  is the time he will need to get from the i-th stop to the University. We need to choose indices with minimal possible ti, and among them - the index with minimal possible si, that is, with maximal bi, that is (since the coordinates of bus stops are already ordered) with maximal i.\n\nNote that due to precision issues, you should be careful when you compare ti: the condition ti = tj should be written in the form |ti?-?tj|?<?? for some small ?.",
