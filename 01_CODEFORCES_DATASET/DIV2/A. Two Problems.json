Two Problems", "statement": "A boy Valera registered on site as , and wrote his first . He boasted to\r\na friend Arkady about winning as much as points for his first contest.\r\nBut Arkady did not believe his friend\u2019s words and decided to check\r\nwhether Valera could have shown such a result.He knows that the contest\r\nnumber was unusual because there were only two problems. The contest\r\nlasted for minutes, the minutes are numbered starting from zero. The\r\nfirst problem had the initial cost of points, and every minute its cost\r\nreduced by points. The second problem had the initial cost of points,\r\nand every minute this cost reduced by points. Thus, as soon as the zero\r\nminute of the contest is over, the first problem will cost points, and\r\nthe second problem will cost points. It is guaranteed that at any moment\r\nof the contest each problem has a non-negative cost.Arkady asks you to\r\nfind out whether Valera could have got exactly points for this contest.\r\nYou should assume that Valera could have solved any number of the\r\noffered problems. You should also assume that for each problem Valera\r\nmade no more than one attempt, besides, he could have submitted both\r\nproblems at the same minute of the contest, starting with minute and\r\nending with minute number . Please note that Valera can\u2019t submit a\r\nsolution exactly minutes after the start of the contest or later.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<iostream>\n#include<fstream>\n#include<cstdio>\n#include<cstdlib>\n#include<cstring>\n#include<algorithm>\n#include<iomanip>\n#include<string>\n#include<vector>\n#include<map>\n#include<queue>\n#include<ctime>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint sa[1005],sb[1005];\n\nint main()\n{\n\tint x,a,da,b,db,t;\n\tcin>>x>>t>>a>>b>>da>>db;\n\tfor(int i=1;i<=t;i++)\n\t{\n\t\tsa[i]=a-(i-1)*da;\n\t\tsb[i]=b-(i-1)*db;\n\t}\n\tint ans=0;\n\tsa[0]=0;sb[0]=0;\n\tfor(int i=0;i<=t;i++)\n\tfor(int j=0;j<=t;j++)\n\t{\n\t\tif(sa[i]+sb[j]==x)\n\t\tans=1;\n\t}\n\tif(ans) cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\telse cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}\n/*\nOrz\n*/\n\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
