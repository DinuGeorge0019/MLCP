    "editorial": "Notice that since there are residents, there must be shares.There are\r\ntwo types of shares. A share directly by Pak Chanek to a resident, and a\r\nshare by a resident to another resident. A share by Pak Chanek is\r\nunlimited, while a share by a resident is limited by . So there are\r\nunlimited shares with cost and for each , there are shares with cost .In\r\nthe beginning, no residents are notified about the announcement, so Pak\r\nChanek must share once to some resident in the beginning.After that,\r\nsince there are residents remaining, there must be shares.\r\nTheoretically, the lowerbound of the minimum cost is the cheapest shares\r\n(including Pak Chanekâs shares). Turns out, there is always a strategy\r\nto use the cheapest shares to notify all residents after the first share\r\nby Pak Chanek.The strategy is we share the announcement to the residents\r\nwith the smallest values of first. Using the fact that , we can deduce\r\nthat we will always have a resident with an available share.We can solve\r\nthis using a simple sorting or a priority queue. Keep in mind about the\r\nunlimited shares with cost .Time complexity for each test case:\r\n",
