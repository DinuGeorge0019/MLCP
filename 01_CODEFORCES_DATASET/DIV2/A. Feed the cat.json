The\r\ncat’s current hunger level is points, moreover each minute without food\r\nincreases his hunger by points.At any time Andrew can visit the store\r\nwhere tasty buns are sold (you can assume that is doesn’t take time to\r\nget to the store and back). One such bun costs roubles and decreases\r\nhunger by points. Since the demand for bakery drops heavily in the\r\nevening, there is a special discount for buns starting from : (note that\r\nthe cost might become rational). Of course, buns cannot be sold by\r\nparts.Determine the minimum amount of money Andrew has to spend in order\r\nto feed his cat. The cat is considered fed if its hunger level is less\r\nthan or equal to zero.\r\n",
