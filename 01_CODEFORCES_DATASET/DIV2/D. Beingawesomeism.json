Each cell on the grid represents a country. Each country\r\nhas a dominant religion. There are only two religions in your world. One\r\nof the religions is called Beingawesomeism, who do good for the sake of\r\nbeing good. The other religion is called Pushingittoofarism, who do\r\nmurders for the sake of being bad.Oh, and you are actually not really\r\nall-powerful. You just have one power, which you can use infinitely many\r\ntimes! Your power involves . When a missionary group of a certain\r\ncountry, say a, passes by another country b, they change the dominant\r\nreligion of country b to the dominant religion of country a.In\r\nparticular, a single use of your power is this: You choose a horizontal\r\n1\r\ntimes x subgrid or a vertical x\r\ntimes 1 subgrid. That value of x is up to you; You choose a direction d.\r\nIf you chose a horizontal subgrid, your choices will either be NORTH or\r\nSOUTH. If you choose a vertical subgrid, your choices will either be\r\nEAST or WEST; You choose the number s of steps; You command each country\r\nin the subgrid to send a missionary group that will travel s steps\r\ntowards direction d. In each step, they will visit (and in effect\r\nconvert the dominant religion of) all s countries they pass through, as\r\ndetailed above. The parameters x, d, s must be chosen in such a way that\r\nany of the missionary groups won\u2019t leave the grid. The following image\r\nillustrates one possible single usage of your power. Here, represents a\r\ncountry with dominant religion Beingawesomeism and represents a country\r\nwith dominant religion Pushingittoofarism. Here, we\u2019ve chosen a 1\r\ntimes 4 subgrid, the direction NORTH, and s = 2 steps. You are a being\r\nwhich believes in free will, for the most part. However, you just really\r\nwant to stop receiving murders that are attributed to your name. Hence,\r\nyou decide to use your powers and try to make Beingawesomeism the\r\ndominant religion in every country.What is the minimum number of usages\r\nof your power needed to convert everyone to Beingawesomeism?With god,\r\nnothing is impossible. But maybe you\u2019re not god? If it is impossible to\r\nmake Beingawesomeism the dominant religion in all countries, you must\r\nalso admit your mortality and say so.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int M = 1e9 + 7;\nconst int N = 1234567;\nstring s[N];\n\nint main() {\n    int t; cin >> t;\n    for (int tt = 0; tt < t; tt++) {\n        int n, m;\n        cin >> n >> m;\n        int x = 0, y = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            cin >> s[i];\n            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n                if (s[i][j] == 'P') {\n                    x = 1;\n                }\n                if (s[i][j] == 'A') {\n                    y = 1;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        if (x == 0) {\n            cout << 0 << \"\\n\";\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (y == 0) {\n            cout << \"MORTAL\\n\";\n            continue;\n        }\n        int a = 4;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int u = -1e9, v = 1e9;\n            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n                u = max(u, (int) s[i][j]);\n                v = min(v, (int) s[i][j]);\n                if (s[i][j] == 'A') {\n                    int t = 4;\n                    if (i == 0 || i == n - 1) {\n                        t--;\n                    }\n                    if (j == 0 || j == m - 1) {\n                        t--;\n                    }\n                    a = min(a, t);\n                }\n            }\n            if (u == v && u == 'A') {\n                if (i == 0 || i == n - 1) {\n                    a = min(a, 1);\n                }\n                else {\n                    a = min(a, 2);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n            int u = -1e9, v = 1e9;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                u = max(u, (int) s[i][j]);\n                v = min(v, (int) s[i][j]);\n            }\n            if (u == v && u == 'A') {\n                if (j == 0 || j == m - 1) {\n                    a = min(a, 1);\n                }\n                else {\n                    a = min(a, 2);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        cout << a << \"\\n\";\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "greedy", "implementation", "math"], "dificulty": "1800", "interactive": false}
