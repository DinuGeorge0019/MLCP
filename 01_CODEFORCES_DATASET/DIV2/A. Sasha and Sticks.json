So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone\r\nor with friends.Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena,\r\nwith whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws sticks in\r\na row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly sticks\r\nfrom left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the\r\ninventor of the game. If there are less than sticks on the paper before\r\nsome turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves\r\nthan Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing,\r\nyou are to help him.\r\n",
