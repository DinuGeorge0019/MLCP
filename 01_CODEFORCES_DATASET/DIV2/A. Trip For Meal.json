    "statement": "Winnie-the-Pooh likes honey very much! That is why he decided to visit\r\nhis friends. Winnie has got three best friends: Rabbit, Owl and Eeyore,\r\neach of them lives in his own house. There are winding paths between\r\neach pair of houses. The length of a path between Rabbit’s and Owl’s\r\nhouses is meters, between Rabbit’s and Eeyore’s house is meters, between\r\nOwl’s and Eeyore’s house is meters.For enjoying his life and singing\r\nmerry songs Winnie-the-Pooh should have a meal times a day. Now he is in\r\nthe Rabbit’s house and has a meal for the first time. Each time when in\r\nthe friend’s house where Winnie is now the supply of honey is about to\r\nend, Winnie leaves that house. If Winnie has not had a meal the required\r\namount of times, he comes out from the house and goes to someone else of\r\nhis two friends. For this he chooses one of two adjacent paths, arrives\r\nto the house on the other end and visits his friend. You may assume that\r\nwhen Winnie is eating in one of his friend’s house, the supply of honey\r\nin other friend’s houses recover (most probably, they go to the supply\r\nstore).Winnie-the-Pooh does not like physical activity. He wants to have\r\na meal times, traveling minimum possible distance. Help him to find this\r\ndistance.\r\n",
