He will have to re-sit\r\neach failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark . The author would need\r\nto spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly\r\nmore than . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other\r\nhand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than , the author’s mum\r\nwon’t be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they\r\nalways get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors\r\njust hate re-sitting exams. Help the author and find the minimum number\r\nof exams he will have to re-sit if he passes the exams in the way that\r\nmakes the sum of marks for all exams equal exactly .\r\n",
