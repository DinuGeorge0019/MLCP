Today, a\r\nprofessor told his students that the grades for his course would be\r\ngiven out automatically he would calculate the simple average\r\n(arithmetic mean) of all grades given out for lab works this term and\r\nround to the nearest integer. The rounding would be done in favour of\r\nthe student 4.5 would be rounded up to 5 (as in example 3), but 4.4\r\nwould be rounded down to 4.This does not bode well for Vasya who didn\u2019t\r\nthink those lab works would influence anything, so he may receive a\r\ngrade worse than 5 (maybe even the dreaded 2). However, the professor\r\nallowed him to redo some of his works of Vasya\u2019s choosing to increase\r\nhis average grade. Vasya wants to redo as as few lab works as possible\r\nin order to get 5 for the course. Of course, Vasya will get 5 for the\r\nlab works he chooses to redo.Help Vasya calculate the minimum amount of\r\nlab works Vasya has to redo.\r\n", "solutions": ["// who's it from?\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long ll;\ntypedef pair<int, int> pii;\n#define f first\n#define s second\n#define SZ(x) (int)(x).size()\n#define ALL(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()\n\nint32_t main() {\n\tios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n\tcin.tie(0);\n\tint n;\n\tcin >> n;\n\tvector<int> a(n);\n\tint sum = 0;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\t\tcin >> a[i];\n\t\tsum += 2 * a[i];\n\t}\n\tsort(ALL(a));\n\tint i = 0;\n\twhile (sum < 9 * n) {\n\t\tsum -= 2 * a[i];\n\t\tsum += 2 * 5;\n\t\ti++;\n\t}\n\tcout << i << endl;\n\treturn 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy", "sortings"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
