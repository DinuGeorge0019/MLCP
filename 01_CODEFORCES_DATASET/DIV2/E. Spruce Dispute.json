Spruce Dispute", "statement": "It\u2019s already a hot April outside, and Polycarp decided that this is the\r\nperfect time to finally take down the spruce tree he set up several\r\nyears ago. As he spent several hours walking around it, gathering his\r\nstrength, he noticed something curious: the spruce is actually a tree^{\r\ntext{ }} and not just any tree, but one consisting of an number of\r\nvertices n. Moreover, on n-1 of the vertices hang Christmas ornaments,\r\npainted in exactly\r\nfrac{n-1}{2} distinct colors, with exactly two ornaments painted in each\r\ncolor. The remaining vertex, as tradition dictates, holds the tree\u2019s\r\ntopper.At last, after several days of mental preparation, Polycarp began\r\ndismantling the spruce. First, he removed the topper and had already\r\nstarted taking apart some branches when suddenly a natural question\r\nstruck him: how can he remove one of the tree\u2019s edges and rearrange the\r\nornaments in such a way that the sum of the lengths of the simple paths\r\nbetween ornaments of the same color is as large as possible?In this\r\nproblem, removing an edge from the tree is defined as follows: choose a\r\npair of adjacent vertices a and b (a < b), then remove vertex b from the\r\ntree and reattach all of b\u2019s adjacent vertices (except for a) directly\r\nto a.Polycarp cannot continue dismantling his spruce until he gets an\r\nanswer to this question. However, checking all possible options would\r\ntake him several more years. Knowing your experience in competitive\r\nprogramming, he turned to you for help. But can you solve this\r\ndispute?^{\r\ntext{ }}A tree is a connected graph without cycles.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "dfs and similar", "graphs", "greedy", "implementation", "shortest paths", "trees"], "dificulty": "2600", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV2\\E.
