Tokitsukaze and Mahjong", "statement": "Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this\r\ngame, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited\r\ntile, which means it has a suit (, or ) and a number (a digit ranged\r\nfrom 1 to 9). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase\r\nletter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited\r\ntile. All possible suited tiles are represented as , ,\r\nldots, , , ,\r\nldots, , , ,\r\nldots, .In order to win the game, she must have at least one (described\r\nbelow) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles.\r\nAfter drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can\r\ndraw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you\r\nknow the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that\r\nshe can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game: A , also\r\nknown as meld, is formed by a or a ; A , also known as triplet, is made\r\nof three identical tiles, such as , however, or is NOT a ; A , also\r\nknown as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the\r\nsame suit, such as and , however, or is NOT a . Some examples: it\r\ncontains no or , so it includes no ; it contains a , , but no , so it\r\nincludes a ; it contains no but a , or , so it includes a . Note that\r\nthe order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each\r\ntype of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#define rep(i,a,b) for (int i=(a); i<=(b); i++)\n#define per(i,a,b) for (int i=(a); i>=(b); i--)\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\n\ninline int read() {\n    int x=0,f=1; char ch=getchar();\n    while (!(ch>='0'&&ch<='9')) {if (ch=='-')f=-1;ch=getchar();}\n    while (ch>='0'&&ch<='9') {x=x*10+(ch-'0'); ch=getchar();}\n    return x*f;\n}\n\nchar a[5],b[5],c[5];\n\nint main() {\n\n\tscanf(\"%s\",a); scanf(\"%s\",b); scanf(\"%s\",c);\n\tif (a[1]==b[1]&&a[1]==c[1]) {\n\t\tint x=a[0]-'0',y=b[0]-'0',z=c[0]-'0';\n\t\tif (x>y) swap(x,y); if (x>z) swap(x,z);\n\t\tif (y>z) swap(y,z);\n\t\tif (x==y&&y==z) puts(\"0\");\n\t\telse if (y-x==1&&z-y==1) puts(\"0\");\n\t\telse if (abs(x-y)<=2||abs(y-z)<=2) puts(\"1\");\n\t\telse puts(\"2\");\n\t} else {\n\t\tif (a[1]==b[1]) {\n\t\t\tint x=a[0]-'0',y=b[0]-'0';\n\t\t\tif (abs(x-y)<=2) puts(\"1\");\n\t\t\telse puts(\"2\");\n\t\t} else if (a[1]==c[1]) {\n\t\t\tint x=a[0]-'0',y=c[0]-'0';\n\t\t\tif (abs(x-y)<=2) puts(\"1\");\n\t\t\telse puts(\"2\");\n\t\t} else if (b[1]==c[1]) {\n\t\t\tint x=c[0]-'0',y=b[0]-'0';\n\t\t\tif (abs(x-y)<=2) puts(\"1\");\n\t\t\telse puts(\"2\");\n\t\t} else puts(\"2\");\n\t}\n\n\treturn 0;\n\t\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1200", "interactive": false}
