    "statement": "Andrew often reads articles in his favorite magazine 2Char. The main\r\nfeature of these articles is that each of them uses at most two distinct\r\nletters. Andrew decided to send an article to the magazine, but as he\r\nhasn’t written any article, he just decided to take a random one from\r\nmagazine 26Char. However, before sending it to the magazine 2Char, he\r\nneeds to adapt the text to the format of the journal. To do so, he\r\nremoves some words from the chosen article, in such a way that the\r\nremaining text can be written using no more than two distinct\r\nletters.Since the payment depends from the number of non-space\r\ncharacters in the article, Andrew wants to keep the words with the\r\nmaximum total length.\r\n",
