    "editorial": "If we fix the value of k, and let d?=?div(x,?b), m?=?mod(x,?b), we have :\nd?=?mk\nx?=?db?+?m\nSo we have x?=?mkb?+?m?=?(kb?+?1)?*?m.\nAnd we know m would be in range [1,?b?-?1] because it's a remainder and x is positive, so the sum of x of that fixed k would be .\nNext we should notice that if an integer x is nice it can only be nice for a single particular k because a given x uniquely defines div(x,?b) and mod(x,?b).\nThus the final answer would be sum up for all individual k:  which can be calculated in O(a) and will pass the time limit of 1.5 seconds.\nAlso the formula above can be expanded to . Dreamoon says he's too lazy to do this part, so if you use O(1) solution you just computed the answer faster than Dreamoon!!!\nNote that no matter which approach one should be very careful of overflowing of the integer data type of the used language. For example one should do a module after every multiplication if using 64-bit integer type. And pay attention to precedence of operations: take c++ for example a+b%c would be executed as a+(b%c) instead of (a+b)%c, another c++ example a*(b*c)%m would be executed as (a*(b*c))%m instead of a*((b*c)%m).\nThanks saurabhsuniljain for pointing out the preceding problem and examples in the comment!\ntime complexity: O(1)",
