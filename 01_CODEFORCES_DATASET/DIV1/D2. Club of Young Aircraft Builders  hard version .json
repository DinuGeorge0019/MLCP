There is exactly one person living on each floor.All the residents\r\nof the building have an important goal today: to launch at least c paper\r\nairplanes collectively. The residents will launch the airplanes in turn.\r\nWhen a person from the i-th floor launches an airplane, all residents on\r\nfloors from 1 to i can see it as it descends to the ground. If, from the\r\nperspective of the resident on the i-th floor, at least c airplanes have\r\nalready been launched, they will no longer launch airplanes themselves.\r\nIt is also known that by the end of the day, from the perspective of\r\neach resident in the building, at least c airplanes have been launched,\r\nand a total of m airplanes were thrown.You have been carefully\r\nmonitoring this flash mob, and for each airplane, you recorded which\r\nresident from which floor threw it. Unfortunately, the information about\r\nwho exactly threw some of the airplanes has been lost. Find the number\r\nof ways to fill in the gaps so that the information could be credible.\r\nSince the answer could be quite large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.It is\r\nalso possible that you made a mistake in your records, and there is no\r\npossible way to restore the gaps. In that case, the answer is considered\r\nto be 0.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "dp", "math"], "dificulty": "2900", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV1\\D2.
