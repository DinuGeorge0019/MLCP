    "statement": "A team of students from the city S is sent to the All-Berland Olympiad\r\nin Informatics. Traditionally, they go on the train. All students have\r\nbought tickets in one carriage, consisting of compartments (each\r\ncompartment has exactly four people). We know that if one compartment\r\ncontain one or two students, then they get bored, and if one compartment\r\ncontain three or four students, then the compartment has fun throughout\r\nthe entire trip.The students want to swap with other people, so that no\r\ncompartment with students had bored students. To swap places with\r\nanother person, you need to convince him that it is really necessary.\r\nThe students can not independently find the necessary arguments, so they\r\nasked a sympathetic conductor for help. The conductor can use her life\r\nexperience to persuade any passenger to switch places with some\r\nstudent.However, the conductor does not want to waste time persuading\r\nthe wrong people, so she wants to know what is the minimum number of\r\npeople necessary to persuade her to change places with the students.\r\nYour task is to find the number. After all the swaps each compartment\r\nshould either have no student left, or have a company of three or four\r\nstudents.\r\n",
