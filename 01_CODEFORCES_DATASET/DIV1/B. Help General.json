Help General", "statement": "Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sir Lancelot, the\r\nchief Royal General. He was very proud of his men and he liked to invite\r\nthe King to come and watch drill exercises which demonstrated the\r\nfighting techniques and tactics of the squad he was in charge of. But\r\ntime went by and one day Sir Lancelot had a major argument with the\r\nFairy Godmother (there were rumors that the argument occurred after the\r\ngeneral spoke badly of the Godmother\u2019s flying techniques. That seemed to\r\nhurt the Fairy Godmother very deeply). As the result of the argument,\r\nthe Godmother put a rather strange curse upon the general. It sounded\r\nall complicated and quite harmless: \"\"The drill exercises are held on a\r\nrectangular field, split into square segments for each soldier. Thus,\r\nthe square of the distance between the soldiers that stand on squares\r\nand equals exactly . Now not all squad soldiers can participate in the\r\ndrill exercises as it was before the Fairy Godmother\u2019s curse. Unless, of\r\ncourse, the general wants the soldiers to fight with each other or even\r\nworse... For example, if he puts a soldier in the square , then he\r\ncannot put soldiers in the squares , , and each of them will conflict\r\nwith the soldier in the square .Your task is to help the general. You\r\nare given the size of the drill exercise field. You are asked to\r\ncalculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously\r\npositioned on this field, so that no two soldiers fall under the Fairy\r\nGodmother\u2019s curse.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <string>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <cassert>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <queue>\n#include <memory.h>\n#include <stack>\n#define mp make_pair\n#define pb push_back                     \n#define setval(a,v) memset(a,v,sizeof(a))\n\n#if ( _WIN32 || __WIN32__ )\n    #define LLD \"%I64d\"\n#else\n    #define LLD \"%lld\"\n#endif\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long long ll;\ntypedef long double ld;\n\nint color[1100][1100];\n\nint cnt[2];\nint n,m;\n\nvoid dfs(int x,int y,int c){\n    if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= n || y >= m)\n        return;\n    if (color[x][y] != -1){\n        assert(color[x][y] == c);\n        return;\n    }\n    color[x][y] = c;\n    cnt[c]++;\n    for (int i = -1; i <= 1; i+=2)\n        for (int j = -1; j <= 1; j+=2){\n            dfs(x+i,y+2*j,1-c);\n            dfs(x+2*j,y+i,1-c);\n        }\n    return;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n  #ifdef LOCAL\n    freopen(\"input.txt\",\"r\",stdin);\n    freopen(\"output.txt\",\"w\",stdout);\n  #endif\n    scanf(\"%d %d\",&n,&m);\n    memset(color,-1,sizeof(color));\n\n    int ans = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)\n           if (color[i][j] == -1){\n              cnt[0] = cnt[1] = 0;\n              dfs(i,j,0);\n              ans += max(cnt[0],cnt[1]);\n           } \n\n    cout << ans << endl;\n  return 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["constructive algorithms", "greedy", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1800", "interactive": false}
