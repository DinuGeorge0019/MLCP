    "statement": "One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of rooms,\r\nnumbered from to . Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out\r\nof the maze, he needs to get to the -th one.The maze is organized as\r\nfollows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let\u2019s consider\r\nroom number , someone can use the first portal to move from it to room\r\nnumber , also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room\r\nnumber , where .In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as\r\nfollows. Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its\r\nceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room . Let\u2019s\r\nassume that Vasya is in room and has already painted a cross on its\r\nceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses,\r\nVasya uses the second portal (it leads to room ), otherwise Vasya uses\r\nthe first portal. Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to\r\nuse portals to get to room in the end.\r\n",
