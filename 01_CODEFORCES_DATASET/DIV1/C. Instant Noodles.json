For\r\na subset S of vertices of the half we define N(S) as the set of all\r\nvertices of the right half adjacent to at least one vertex in S, and\r\nf(S) as the sum of all numbers in vertices of N(S). Find the greatest\r\ncommon divisor of f(S) for all possible non-empty subsets S (assume that\r\nGCD of empty set is 0).Wu is too tired after his training to solve this\r\nproblem. Help him!\r\n",

Then answer equals\r\nto of sums of numbers in all groups except the group with empty\r\nneighboring set. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prove it.If there are some vertices with same\r\nlist of neighbors then they will both in some or none of them will be in\r\nit. It means that we can replace such vertices with one vertex with\r\nvalue equals to sum of values in these vertices. After that numbers in\r\nall vertices are divisible by answer and thus sum of every subset is\r\ndivisible by it. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s divide all the numbers by answer and prove that\r\nafter it answer will be 1.Consider some integer and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find some set\r\nof vertices such that is not divisible by . If sum of all numbers is not\r\ndivisible by we can take all the left half and its sum is not divisible\r\nby . Otherwise consider a vertex with minimum degree such that its value\r\nis not divisible by (such vertex exists because gcd of numbers in right\r\nhalf is 1 now). Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take subset of vertices in left part which are not\r\nconnected to . Which vertices are not neighboring to this set? It is and\r\nall the vertices that their neighboring set it a subset of neighboring\r\nset of (and their sum is divisible by ). But value of is not divisible\r\nby so sum in complement of its neighboring set is not divisible by too.\r\n"
