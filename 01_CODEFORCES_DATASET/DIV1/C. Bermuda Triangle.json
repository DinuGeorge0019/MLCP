Bermuda Triangle", "statement": "The Bermuda Triangle a mysterious area in the Atlantic Ocean where,\r\naccording to rumors, ships and airplanes disappear without a trace. Some\r\nblame magnetic anomalies, others portals to other worlds, but the truth\r\nremains hidden in a fog of mysteries.A regular passenger flight 814 was\r\ntraveling from Miami to Nassau on a clear sunny day. Nothing\r\nforeshadowed trouble until the plane entered a zone of strange\r\nflickering fog. Radio communication was interrupted, the instruments\r\nspun wildly, and flashes of unearthly light flickered outside the\r\nwindows.For simplicity, we will assume that the Bermuda Triangle and the\r\nairplane are on a plane, and the vertices of the triangle have\r\ncoordinates (0, 0), (0, n), and (n, 0). Initially, the airplane is\r\nlocated at the point (x, y) the Bermuda Triangle and is moving with a\r\nvelocity vector (v_x, v_y). All instruments have failed, so the crew\r\ncannot control the airplane.The airplane can escape from the triangle if\r\nit ever reaches exactly one of the vertices of the triangle. However, if\r\nat any moment (possibly non-integer) the airplane hits the boundary of\r\nthe triangle (but not at a vertex), its velocity vector is immediately\r\nreflected relative to that side^\r\ndagger, and the airplane continues to move in the new\r\ndirection.Determine whether the airplane can ever escape from the\r\nBermuda Triangle (i.e., reach exactly one of its vertices). If this is\r\npossible, also calculate how many times before that moment the airplane\r\nwill hit the boundary of the triangle (each touch of the boundary, even\r\nat the same point, counts; crossing a vertex does not count).^\r\ndagger Reflection occurs according to the usual laws of physics. The\r\nangle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["chinese remainder theorem", "geometry", "implementation", "math", "number theory"], "dificulty": "2400", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV1\\C.
