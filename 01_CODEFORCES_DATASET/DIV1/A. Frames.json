Moreover, he got disappointed in it so much,\r\nthat he decided to destroy his secret archive for good. Igor K. use\r\nPindows XR operation system which represents files and folders by small\r\nicons. At that, icons can fit in a horizontal row in any window.Igor\r\nK.\u2019s computer contains folders in the D: disk\u2019s root catalog. The\r\nfolders are numbered from to in the order from the left to the right and\r\nfrom top to bottom (see the images). At that the folders with secret\r\nvideos have numbers from to inclusive. Igor K. wants to delete them\r\nforever, at that making as few frame selections as possible, and then\r\npressing Shift+Delete exactly once. What is the minimum number of times\r\nIgor K. will have to select the folder in order to select folders from\r\nto and only them? Let us note that if some selected folder is selected\r\nrepeatedly, then it is deselected. Each selection possesses the shape of\r\nsome rectangle with sides parallel to the screen\u2019s borders.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <deque>\n#include <queue>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <functional>\n#include <utility>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <cstdio>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define REP(i,n) for((i)=0;(i)<(int)(n);(i)++)\n#define foreach(c,itr) for(__typeof((c).begin()) itr=(c).begin();itr!=(c).end();itr++)\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nint func(ll W, ll low, ll high, ll N){\n    int i;\n    if(high <= low/W*W + W) return 1;\n    if(low%W == 0 && high%W == 0) return 1;\n    if(low%W == 0 && high == N) return 1;\n    if(high <= low/W*W + 2*W) return 2;\n    if(low%W == 0 || high%W == 0) return 2;\n    if(low%W == high%W) return 2;\n    if(high == N) return 2;\n    return 3;\n}\n\nint main(void){\n    int n,m,a,b;\n    cin >> n >> m >> a >> b;\n    int ans = func(m,a-1,b,n);\n    cout << ans << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "1700", "interactive": false}
