Sorting the Coins", "statement": "Recently, Dima met with Sasha in a philatelic store, and since then they\r\nare collecting coins together. Their favorite occupation is to sort\r\ncollections of coins. Sasha likes having things in order, that is why he\r\nwants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come\r\ncoins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation. For\r\narranging coins Dima uses the following algorithm. One step of his\r\nalgorithm looks like the following: He looks through all the coins from\r\nleft to right; If he sees that the -th coin is still in circulation, and\r\n-th coin is already out of circulation, he exchanges these two coins and\r\ncontinues watching coins from -th. Dima repeats the procedure above\r\nuntil it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure.\r\nDima calls the number of steps required for him according to the\r\nalgorithm above to sort the sequence, e.g. the number of times he looks\r\nthrough the coins from the very beginning. For example, for the ordered\r\nsequence hardness of ordering equals one.Today Sasha invited Dima and\r\nproposed him a game. First he puts coins in a row, all of them are out\r\nof circulation. Then Sasha chooses one of the coins out of circulation\r\nand replaces it with a coin in circulation for times. During this\r\nprocess Sasha constantly asks Dima what is the hardness of ordering of\r\nthe sequence. The task is more complicated because Dima should not touch\r\nthe coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind. Help\r\nDima with this task.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<iostream>\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<stdlib.h>\n#include<string.h>\n#include<math.h>\n#include<algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\nint n,x[300010],p;\nint main()\n{\n\t//freopen(\".in\",\"r\",stdin);\n\t//freopen(\".out\",\"w\",stdout);\n\tint i,j,k;\n\tscanf(\"%d\",&n);\n\tprintf(\"1\");\n\tfor(i=1,k=n;i<=n;i++)\n\t  {\n\t   scanf(\"%d\",&j);\n\t   x[j]=1;\n\t   p++;\n\t   while(x[k])\n\t     k--,p--;\n\t   printf(\" %d\",p+1);\n\t  }\n\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["dsu", "implementation", "sortings", "two pointers"], "dificulty": "1500", "interactive": false}
