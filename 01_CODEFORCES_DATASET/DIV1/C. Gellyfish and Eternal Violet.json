The\r\nHP of the i-th monster is h_i.Gellyfish doesn\u2019t want to kill them, but\r\nshe wants to keep these monsters from being a threat to her. So she\r\nwants to reduce the HP of all the monsters to exactly 1.Now, Gellyfish,\r\nwith The Sword Sharpened with Tears, is going to attack the monsters for\r\nm rounds. For each round: The Sword Sharpened with Tears shines with a\r\nprobability of p. Gellyfish can choose whether to attack: If Gellyfish\r\ndoesn\u2019t attack, nothing happens. If Gellyfish chooses to attack and The\r\nSword Sharpened with Tears shines, the HP of all the monsters will be\r\nreduced by 1. If Gellyfish chooses to attack and The Sword Sharpened\r\nwith Tears does not shine, Gellyfish can choose one of the monsters and\r\nreduce its HP by 1. Please note that before Gellyfish decides whether or\r\nnot to attack, she will know whether the sword shines or not. Also, when\r\nthe sword shines, Gellyfish can only make attacks on all the monsters\r\nand cannot make an attack on only one monster.Now, Gellyfish wants to\r\nknow what the probability is that she will reach her goal if she makes\r\nchoices optimally during the battle.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "dp", "greedy", "math", "probabilities"], "dificulty": "", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV1\\C.
