    "editorial": "SolutionThe first fact to notice is that if the subgrid does not contain\r\n, then the MEX is and we can ignore such subgrids. If the MEX is going\r\nto be , it means all the values from to are included in the subgrid. For\r\neach , we count how many subgrids have a MEX of at least , aiming to\r\nmaximize this.To find the total sum of all MEX values, for each we count\r\nthe number of subgrids that contain all the values from to . Summing\r\nthese counts gives us the final result. We claim that if our subgrid is\r\nnearly square (either a perfect square or a difference of in lengths),\r\nand is placed in the middle of the grid, then the answer is maximized.\r\nProof: The multiplication of two numbers with the same sum is maximized\r\nwhen they are as close to each other as possible. Therefore, for each\r\nsubgrid, if we consider the empty rows above and below it and separately\r\nconsider the columns on its right and left, if one is fixed, the place\r\nis optimized to be in the middle. Now, similarly, we can say that it is\r\noptimal if the length and height of the subgrid are close to each other\r\nas well, as increasing one will cause the other one to decrease. With\r\nthese two observations combined, a subgrid having the above properties\r\nis optimal when it’s a nearly square subgrid in the middle of the\r\ngrid.Any ordering with this property works; an easy example is a spiral\r\nshape that starts from the center of the grid and turns around itself.\r\n",
