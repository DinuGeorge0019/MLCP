They want to split their treasure\r\nfairly amongst themselves, that is why You, their trusted financial\r\nadvisor, devised a game to help them:All of them take a sit at their\r\nround table, some of them with the golden coins they have just stolen.\r\nAt each iteration of the game if one of them has equal or more than 2\r\ncoins, he is eligible to the splitting and he gives one coin to each\r\npirate sitting next to him. If there are more candidates (pirates with\r\nequal or more than 2 coins) then are the one that chooses which of them\r\nwill do the splitting in that iteration. The game ends when there are no\r\nmore candidates eligible to do the splitting. Pirates can call it a day,\r\nonly when the game ends. Since they are beings with a finite amount of\r\ntime at their disposal, they would prefer if the game that they are\r\nplaying can end after finite iterations, and if so, they call it a . On\r\nthe other hand, if no matter how do the splitting, the game cannot end\r\nin finite iterations, they call it a . Can You help them figure out\r\nbefore they start playing if the game will be good or bad?\r\n", "solutions": ["/**\n *    author:  tourist\n *    created: 05.10.2020 18:11:30       \n**/\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n  cin.tie(0);\n  int n, k;\n  cin >> n >> k;\n  long long sum = 0;\n  long long cnt = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n    long long a, b;\n    cin >> a >> b;\n    sum += (n - a + 1) * b % n;\n    cnt += b;\n  }\n  if (cnt != n) {\n    cout << (cnt < n ? 1 : -1) << '\\n';\n    return 0;\n  }\n  long long expected = (long long) n * (n + 1) / 2;\n  cout << (sum % n == expected % n ? 1 : -1) << '\\n';\n  return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["math"], "dificulty": "2700", "interactive": false}
