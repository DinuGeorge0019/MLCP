However, the people you worked with sabotaged\r\nyou because they wanted to publish this sequence first. They deleted one\r\nnumber from this sequence and shuffled the rest, leaving you with a\r\nsequence b_1, b_2,\r\nldots, b_{2n}. You have forgotten the sequence a and want to find a way\r\nto recover it.If there are many possible sequences, you can output any\r\nof them. It can be proven under the constraints of the problem that at\r\nleast one sequence a exists.\r\n",
