All edges a\r\nrightarrow b satisfy a<b.You start in vertex 1 with some coins. You need\r\nto move from vertex 1 to the vertex where the boss is located along the\r\ndirected edges, and then fight with the final boss.Each of the n\r\nvertices of the graph contains a Trader who will sell you a card with\r\npower w_i for c_i coins. You can buy as many cards as you want from each\r\nTrader. However, you can only trade with the trader on the i-th vertex\r\nif you are currently on the i-th vertex.In order to defeat the boss, you\r\nwant the sum of the power of your cards to be as large as possible.You\r\nwill have to answer the following q queries: Given integers p and r. If\r\nthe final boss is located at vertex p, and you have r coins in the\r\nbeginning, what is the maximum sum of the power of your cards when you\r\nfight the final boss? Note that you are allowed to trade cards on vertex\r\np.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["dp", "graphs"], "dificulty": "", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV1\\E.
