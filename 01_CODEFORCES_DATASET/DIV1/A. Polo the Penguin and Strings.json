No\r\ntwo neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent\r\na string as , then the following inequality holds, .

    "editorial": "To solve this problem we need to find out some contruction of resulting string. But first of all, we need find out when there is no result. Obviously, if k?>?n, there is not result \u0097 you cannot build string of length n with more than n characters. Another one case is when k?=?1 and n?>?1 \u0097 there is no answer in that case also.\n\nConsider that k?=?2. It's really easy to see that answer for such case is a string of form abababab.... To construct string for k?>?2 you need to add some extra characters \u0097 c,?d,?e.... To make string lexicographically smallest, you need to add that characters as close to the end as we can. And the best bet here is abbabab...abacdefgh.... So, we need just to add characters c,?d,?e,?f... (i. e. k?-?2 characters from c) to the end of the string."
