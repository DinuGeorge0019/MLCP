As any person who plays the game, he is interested in\r\nequipping his hero with as good weapon and outfit as possible. One day,\r\nas he was reading the game\u2019s forum yet again, he discovered a very\r\ninteresting fact. As it turns out, each weapon in the game is\r\ncharacterised with different numbers: . They are called hit indicators\r\nand according to the game developers\u2019 plan they are pairwise coprime.\r\nThe damage that is inflicted during a hit depends not only on the\r\nweapon\u2019s characteristics, but also on the hero\u2019s strength parameter.\r\nThus, if the hero\u2019s strength equals , than the inflicted damage will be\r\ncalculated as the number of numbers on the segment , that aren\u2019t\r\ndivisible by any hit indicator .Recently, having fulfilled another\r\nquest, Igor K. found a new Lostborn sword. He wants to know how much\r\ndamage he will inflict upon his enemies if he uses it.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <deque>\n#include <queue>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <functional>\n#include <utility>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <cstdio>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define REP(i,n) for((i)=0;(i)<(int)(n);(i)++)\n#define foreach(c,itr) for(__typeof((c).begin()) itr=(c).begin();itr!=(c).end();itr++)\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nint K,a[110];\nll dp[102][300010];\n\nll func(int pos, ll N){\n    if(pos == 0) return N;\n    if(N < 300000 && dp[pos][N] != -1) return dp[pos][N];\n    ll ans = func(pos-1,N) - func(pos-1,N/a[pos-1]);\n    if(N < 300000) dp[pos][N] = ans;\n    return ans;\n}\n\nint main(void){\n    ll N;\n    int i,j;\n    \n    cin >> N;\n    cin >> K;\n    REP(i,K) cin >> a[i];\n    sort(a,a+K);\n    REP(i,K+1) REP(j,300010) dp[i][j] = -1;\n    \n    ll ans = func(K,N);\n    cout << ans << endl;\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["dp", "math", "number theory"], "dificulty": "2600", "interactive": false}
