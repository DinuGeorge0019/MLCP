Ski Base", "statement": "A ski base is planned to be built in Walrusland. Recently, however, the\r\nproject is still in the constructing phase. A large land lot was chosen\r\nfor the construction. It contains ski junctions, numbered from to .\r\nInitially the junctions aren\u2019t connected in any way.In the constructing\r\nprocess bidirectional ski roads will be built. The roads are built one\r\nafter another: first the road number will be built, then the road number\r\n, and so on. The -th road connects the junctions with numbers and . is\r\nthe route with the following properties: The route is closed, that is,\r\nit begins and ends in one and the same junction. The route contains at\r\nleast one road. The route doesn\u2019t go on one road more than once, however\r\nit can visit any junction any number of times. Let\u2019s consider the as a\r\nnon-empty set of roads that can be divided into one or more tracks so\r\nthat exactly one track went along each road of the chosen set. Besides,\r\neach track can consist only of roads from the chosen set. Ski base\r\ndoesn\u2019t have to be connected.Two ski bases are considered different if\r\nthey consist of different road sets.After building each new road the\r\nWalrusland government wants to know the number of variants of choosing a\r\nski base based on some subset of the already built roads. The government\r\nasks you to help them solve the given problem.\r\n", "solutions": ["#pragma comment(linker, \"/STACK:60000000\")\n#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS\n\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <string>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <cassert>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <iomanip>\n#include <complex>\n#include <queue>\n#include <functional>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define forn(i, n) for(int i = 0; i < (int)(n); i++)\n#define ford(i, n) for(int i = (int)(n) - 1; i >= 0; i--)\n#define pb push_back\n#define mp make_pair\n#define fs first\n#define sc second\n#define last(a) int(a.size() - 1)\n#define all(a) a.begin(), a.end()\n#define seta(a,x) memset (a, x, sizeof (a))\n#define I (int)\n\ntypedef long long int64;\ntypedef pair <int, int> pii;\ntypedef long double ldb;\n\nconst long double eps = 1e-9;\nconst int inf = (1 << 30) - 1;\nconst int64 inf64 = ((int64)1 << 62) - 1;\nconst long double pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795;\n\ntemplate <class T> T sqr (T x) {return x * x;}\n\nint n, m, k;\nint l[100000];\n\nint leader (int v) {\n\tif (l[v] != v)\n\t\tl[v] = leader (l[v]);\n\treturn l[v];\n}\n\nvoid unite (int x, int y) {\n\tx = leader (x);\n\ty = leader (y);\n\tl[y] = x;\n}\n\nint power[1000000];\nconst int P = 1000000009;\n\nint main ()\n{\n//\tfreopen (\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen (\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n\tscanf (\"%d%d\", &n, &m);\n\tpower[0] = 1;\n\tfor (int i = 1; i < 1000000; i ++)\n\t\tpower[i] = (power[i-1] * 2) % P;\t\n\tforn (i, n)\n\t\tl[i] = i;\n\tk = 0;\n\tforn (i, m) {\n\t\tint x, y;\n\t\tscanf (\"%d%d\", &x, &y);\n\t\tif (leader (x) != leader (y)) \n\t\t\tunite (x, y);\n\t\telse\n\t\t\tk ++;\n\t\tprintf (\"%d\\n\", (power[k] + P - 1) % P);\n\t}\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "dsu", "graphs"], "dificulty": "2300", "interactive": false}
