    "statement": "Vasilisa the Wise from a far away kingdom got a present from her friend\r\nHelga the Wise from a farther away kingdom. The present is a surprise\r\nbox, yet Vasilisa the Wise doesn\u2019t know yet what the surprise actually\r\nis because she cannot open the box. She hopes that you can help her in\r\nthat.The box\u2019s lock is constructed like that. The box itself is\r\nrepresented by an absolutely perfect black cube with the identical\r\ndeepening on each face (those are some foreign nanotechnologies that the\r\nfar away kingdom scientists haven\u2019t dreamt of). The box is accompanied\r\nby six gems whose form matches the deepenings in the box\u2019s faces. The\r\nbox can only be opened after it is correctly decorated by the gems, that\r\nis, when each deepening contains exactly one gem. Two ways of decorating\r\nthe box are considered the same if they can be obtained one from the\r\nother one by arbitrarily rotating the box (note that the box is\r\nrepresented by a perfect nanotechnological cube)Now Vasilisa the Wise\r\nwants to know by the given set of colors the following: in how many ways\r\nwould she decorate the box in the worst case to open it? To answer this\r\nquestion it is useful to know that two gems of one color are\r\nindistinguishable from each other. Help Vasilisa to solve this\r\nchallenging problem.\r\n",

    "editorial": "In this problem you were required to find the number of sufficiently different colorings of a cube faces with predefined six colors. The most trivial solution is to introduce some ordering of the cube faces (say, 0 - front, 1 - back, 2 - up, 3 - down, 4 - left, 5 - right), then consider 720 = 6! arrangements of colors over these 6 faces. Each arrangement is some permutation of characters from the input. For each arrangement we find all its 24 rotations - and get 24 strings. Lexicographically smallest string will be representative of this coloring. The answer is the number of different representatives."
