There is exactly one person living on each floor.All the\r\nresidents of the building have a very important goal today: to launch at\r\nleast c paper airplanes collectively. The residents will launch the\r\nairplanes in turn. When a person from the i-th floor launches an\r\nairplane, all residents on the floors from 1 to i can see it as it\r\ndescends to the ground.If, from the perspective of the resident on the\r\ni-th floor, at least c airplanes have already been launched, they will\r\nlaunch any more airplanes themselves. It is also known that by the end\r\nof the day, from the perspective of each resident in the building, at\r\nleast c airplanes have been launched, and a total of m airplanes were\r\nthrown.You carefully monitored this flash mob and recorded which\r\nresident from which floor threw each airplane. Unfortunately, the\r\ninformation about who exactly threw some airplanes has been lost. Find\r\nthe number of ways to fill in the gaps so that the information could be\r\ncredible. Since the answer can be quite large, output it modulo 10^9 +\r\n7.It is also possible that you made a mistake in your records, and there\r\nis no possible way to restore the gaps. In that case, the answer is\r\nconsidered to be 0.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "dp", "math"], "dificulty": "2400", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV1\\D1.
