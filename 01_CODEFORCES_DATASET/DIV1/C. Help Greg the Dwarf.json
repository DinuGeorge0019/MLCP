Help Greg the Dwarf", "statement": "A very unusual citizen lives in a far away kingdom Dwarf Gracula.\r\nHowever, his unusual name is not the weirdest thing (besides, everyone\r\nlong ago got used to calling him simply Dwarf Greg). What is special\r\nabout Dwarf Greg he\u2019s been living for over 200 years; besides, he lives\r\nin a crypt on an abandoned cemetery and nobody has ever seen him out in\r\ndaytime. Moreover, nobody has ever seen Greg buy himself any food.\r\nThat\u2019s why nobody got particularly surprised when after the infernal\r\ndragon\u2019s tragic death cattle continued to disappear from fields. The\r\npeople in the neighborhood were long sure that the harmless dragon was\r\nnever responsible for disappearing cattle (considering that the dragon\r\nused to be sincere about his vegetarian views). But even that\u2019s not the\r\nworst part of the whole story.The worst part is that merely several\r\nminutes ago Dwarf Greg in some unintelligible way got inside your house\r\nand asked you to help him solve a problem. The point is that a short\r\ntime ago Greg decided to order a new coffin (knowing his peculiar\r\ncharacter, you are not surprised at all). But the problem is: a very\r\nlong in both directions L-shaped corridor leads to Greg\u2019s crypt, and you\r\ncan\u2019t drag just any coffin through that corridor. That\u2019s why he asked\r\nyou to help. You\u2019ve formalized the task on a plane like this: let the\r\ncorridor\u2019s width before and after the turn be equal to and\r\ncorrespondingly (see the picture). The corridor turns directly at a\r\nright angle, the coffin is a rectangle whose length and width are equal\r\nto and () correspondingly. Dwarf Greg has already determined the\r\ncoffin\u2019s length (), which is based on his height; your task is to\r\ndetermine the coffin\u2019s maximally possible width (), at which it can be\r\nbrought to the crypt. Besides, due to its large mass (pure marble!) the\r\ncoffin is equipped with rotating wheels; therefore it is impossible to\r\nlift it off the ground, however, arbitrary moves and rotations of the\r\ncoffin in the plane become possible. The coffin may be rotated\r\narbitrarily just before you drag it into crypt and move through the\r\ncorridor.Greg promised that if you help him, he will grant you\r\nimmortality (I wonder how?). And if you don\u2019t, well... trust me, you\r\ndon\u2019t want to know what happens if you don\u2019t help him...\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<stdio.h>\n#include<math.h>\n#include<algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\ndouble a,b,l;\ndouble pi=acos((double)-1);\ninline double solve(){\n    if(a>b)swap(a,b);\n    if(l<=a)return l;\n    else if(l<=b)return a;\n    else{\n\tdouble th=atan(cbrt(a/b));\n\tdouble maxl=b/cos(th)+a/sin(th);\n\tif(l>maxl+1e-7)return -1000;\n\tdouble ll=0,rr=pi/2;\n\tfor(int k=0;k<50;k++){\n\t    double mm=(ll+rr)/2;\n\t    double d=-a*sin(mm)+b*cos(mm)-l*cos(2*mm);\n\t    if(d<0)ll=mm;\n\t    else rr=mm;\n\t}\n\treturn a*cos(ll)+b*sin(ll)-l*sin(2*ll)/2;\n    }\n}\nint main(){\n    scanf(\"%lf%lf%lf\",&a,&b,&l);\n    double t=solve();\n    if(t>=0)printf(\"%.7lf\\n\",solve());\n    else puts(\"My poor head =(\");\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["geometry", "ternary search"], "dificulty": "2500", "interactive": false}
