GUC is finally\r\nparticipating in the Annual Basketball Competition (ABC). A team is to\r\nbe formed of players, all of which are GUC students. However, the team\r\nmight have players belonging to different departments. There are\r\ndepartments in GUC, numbered from to . Herr Wafa\u2019s department has number\r\n. For each department , Herr Wafa knows number how many students who\r\nplay basketball belong to this department.Herr Wafa was also able to\r\nguarantee a spot on the team, using his special powers. But since he\r\nhates floating-point numbers, he needs your help at finding the\r\nprobability that he will have at least one teammate belonging to his\r\ndepartment. Note that every possible team containing Herr Wafa is\r\nequally probable. Consider all the students different from each other.\r\n", "solutions": ["/*\n * b.cpp\n *\n *  Created on: 2011-8-23\n *      Author: mac\n */\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <iostream>\n#define foreach(e,x) for(__typeof(x.begin()) e=x.begin();e!=x.end();++e)\n#define REP(i,n) for(int i=0;i<n;++i)\nusing namespace std;\nconst int MAX_N = 1000 + 10;\nint s[MAX_N];\n\nint main() {\n\tint n, m, h;\n\tint A = 0;\n\tcin >> n >> m >> h;\n\tfor (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {\n\t\tcin >> s[i];\n\t\tA += s[i];\n\t}\n\tint B = A - s[h];\n\t--A;\n\tint x = n - 1;\n\tdouble ans = 1;\n\tif (A < x) {\n\t\tcout << -1 << endl;\n\t\treturn 0;\n\t}\n\tif (B < x) {\n\t\tcout << 1 << endl;\n\t\treturn 0;\n\t}\n\tfor (int i = B + 1; i <= A; ++i) {\n\t\tans /= i;\n\t}\n\tfor (int i = B - x + 1; i <= A - x; ++i) {\n\t\tans *= i;\n\t}\n\tprintf(\"%0.10lf\\n\", 1 - ans);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "dp", "math", "probabilities"], "dificulty": "1600", "interactive": false}
