He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the\r\ndifferent ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one\u2019s\r\nexistence.When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his\r\ngirlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first\r\ntrain to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the\r\ncorresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies:\r\na train goes to Dasha\u2019s direction every minutes, but a train goes to\r\nMasha\u2019s direction every minutes. If two trains approach at the same\r\ntime, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going\r\ntrains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less\r\nfrequently (see the note to the third sample).We know that the trains\r\nbegin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train\r\nschedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains\r\narrive simultaneously.Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go\r\nmore often.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cassert>\n#include <queue>\n#include <bitset>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n\n#define mp make_pair\n#define pb push_back\n#define sz(v) ((int)(v).size())\n#define all(v) (v).begin(),(v).end()\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef pair<int, int> ii;\ntypedef long long int64;\ntypedef vector<int> vi;\n\ntemplate<class T> T abs(T x) {return x > 0 ? x : (-x); }\ntemplate<class T> T sqr(T x) {return x * x; }\n\nint64 gcd(int64 x, int64 y) {\n    if (!y) return x;\n    return gcd(y, x % y);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    int64 a, b;\n    cin >> a >> b;\n    int64 d = gcd(a, b);\n    d = (a * b) / d;\n    int64 x = d / a;\n    int64 y = d / b;\n    if (a < b)\n        ++y;\n    else\n        ++x;\n    if (x > y) cout << \"Dasha\\n\";\n    else if (x < y) cout << \"Masha\\n\";\n    else cout << \"Equal\\n\";\n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation", "math"], "dificulty": "1500", "interactive": false}
