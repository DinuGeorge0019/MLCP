Especially if the holiday is\r\nthe day of the end of exams!Despite the fact that Igor K., unlike his\r\ngroupmates, failed to pass a programming test, he decided to invite them\r\nto go to a cafe so that each of them could drink a bottle of... fresh\r\ncow milk. Having entered the cafe, the friends found different kinds of\r\nmilk on the menu, that\u2019s why they ordered bottles one bottle of each\r\nkind. We know that the volume of milk in each bottle equals .When the\r\nbottles were brought in, they decided to pour all the milk evenly among\r\nthe cups, so that each got a cup. As a punishment for not passing the\r\ntest Igor was appointed the person to pour the milk. He protested that\r\nhe was afraid to mix something up and suggested to distribute the drink\r\nso that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different\r\ncups. His friends agreed but they suddenly faced the following problem\r\nand what is actually the way to do it?Help them and write the program\r\nthat will help to distribute the milk among the cups and drink it as\r\nquickly as possible!Note that due to Igor K.\u2019s perfectly accurate eye\r\nand unswerving hands, he can pour any fractional amount of milk from any\r\nbottle to any cup.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <iostream>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <deque>\n#include <queue>\n#include <set>\n#include <map>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <functional>\n#include <utility>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <cstdio>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define REP(i,n) for((i)=0;(i)<(int)(n);(i)++)\n#define foreach(c,itr) for(__typeof((c).begin()) itr=(c).begin();itr!=(c).end();itr++)\n\nvector <pair <int, int> > cup[60]; // id, amount\n\nint main(void){\n    int N,M,W,i,j;\n    \n    cin >> N >> W >> M;\n    if(M > N && N % (M - N) != 0){\n        cout << \"NO\" << endl;\n        return 0;\n    }\n    \n    REP(i,N){\n        int low = i*M, high = (i+1)*M, mid = low/N*N + N;\n        if(high <= mid){\n            cup[low/N].push_back(make_pair(i+1,M));\n        } else {\n            cup[low/N].push_back(make_pair(i+1,mid-low));\n            cup[low/N+1].push_back(make_pair(i+1,high-mid));\n        }\n    }\n    \n    cout << \"YES\" << endl;\n    REP(i,M) REP(j,cup[i].size()){\n        int id = cup[i][j].first;\n        double amount = (double)cup[i][j].second * W / M;\n        printf(\"%d %.6f\",id,amount);\n        if(j == cup[i].size() - 1) printf(\"\\n\"); else printf(\" \");\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["greedy"], "dificulty": "1900", "interactive": false}
