Tropical Season", "statement": "You have n barrels of infinite capacity. The i-th barrel initially\r\ncontains a_i kilograms of water. In this problem, we assume that all\r\nbarrels weigh the same.You know that one of the barrels has a small\r\namount of tropical poison distributed on its surface, with a total\r\nweight of 0.179 kilograms. However, you do not know which barrel\r\ncontains the poison. Your task is to identify this barrel.All the\r\nbarrels are on scales. Unfortunately, the scales do not show the exact\r\nweight of each barrel. Instead, for each pair of barrels, they show the\r\nresult of a comparison between the weights of those barrels. Thus, for\r\nany two barrels, you can determine whether their weights are equal, and\r\nif not, which barrel is heavier. The poison and water are included in\r\nthe weight of the barrel.The scales are always turned on, and the\r\ninformation from them can be used an unlimited number of times.You also\r\nhave the ability to pour water. You can pour water from any barrel into\r\nany other barrel in any amounts.However, to pour water, you must\r\nphysically handle the barrel from which you are pouring, so if that\r\nhappens to be the poisonous barrel, you will die. This outcome must be\r\navoided.However, you can pour water into the poisonous barrel without\r\ntouching it.In other words, you can choose the numbers i, j, x (i\r\nneq j, 1\r\nleq i, j\r\nleq n, 0 < x\r\nleq a_i, the barrel numbered i is poisonous) and execute a_i := a_i - x,\r\na_j := a_j + x. Where x is not necessarily an integer.Is it possible to\r\nguarantee the identification of which barrel contains the poison and\r\nremain alive using pouring and the information from the scales? You know\r\nthat the poison is located on one of the barrels.Additionally, we ask\r\nyou to process q queries. In each query, either one of the existing\r\nbarrels is removed, or an additional barrel with a certain amount of\r\nwater is added. After each query, you need to answer whether it is\r\npossible to guarantee the identification of the poisonous barrel, given\r\nthat there is exactly one.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["binary search", "data structures", "greedy", "implementation"], "dificulty": "3300", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV1\\E.
