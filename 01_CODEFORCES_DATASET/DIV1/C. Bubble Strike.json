Bubble Strike", "statement": "Little Johnny Bubbles enjoys spending hours in front of his computer\r\nplaying video games. His favorite game is Bubble Strike, fast-paced\r\nbubble shooting online game for two players.Each game is set in one of\r\nthe N maps, each having different terrain configuration. First phase of\r\neach game decides on which map the game will be played. The game system\r\nrandomly selects three maps and shows them to the players. Each player\r\nmust pick one of those three maps to be discarded. The game system then\r\nrandomly selects one of the maps that were not picked by any of the\r\nplayers and starts the game.Johnny is deeply enthusiastic about the game\r\nand wants to spend some time studying maps, thus increasing chances to\r\nwin games played on those maps. However, he also needs to do his\r\nhomework, so he does not have time to study all the maps. That is why he\r\nasked himself the following question: \"What is the minimum number of\r\nmaps I have to study, so that the probability to play one of those maps\r\nis at least P\"?Can you help Johnny find the answer for this question?\r\nYou can assume Johnny\u2019s opponents do not know him, and they will\r\nrandomly pick maps.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#define L(i, j, k) for (int i = (j); i <= (k); ++i) \n#define R(i, j, k) for (int i = (j); i >= (k); --i)  \n#define ll long long\n#define vi vector < int > \n#define sz(a) ((int) (a).size())\nusing namespace std;\nconst int N = 2e5 + 7;\nint n;\ndouble P;\nint C(int x, int t) {\n\tll ret = 1;\n\tL(i, 1, t) ret *= x - i + 1;\n\tL(i, 1, t) ret /= i;\n\treturn ret;\n}\nint main () {\n\tios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n\tcin.tie(0); cout.tie(0); \n\tcin >> n >> P;\n\tL(i, 0, n) {\n\t\tdouble ns = 0;\n\t\tL(a, 0, 3) {\n\t\t\tint sum = C(i, a) * C(n - i, 3 - a);\n\t\t\tif(a == 1) ns += sum * 0.5;\n\t\t\tif(a >= 2) ns += sum;\n\t\t}\n\t\tns /= C(n, 3);\n//\t\tcout << ns << '\\n';\n\t\tif(ns >= P) \n\t\t\treturn cout << i << '\\n', 0;\n\t}\n\treturn 0;\n} "], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "math", "probabilities", "ternary search"], "dificulty": "2000", "interactive": false}
