Heroes", "statement": "The year of 2012 is coming...According to an ancient choradrican legend\r\nin this very year, in 2012, Diablo and his brothers Mephisto and Baal\r\nwill escape from hell, and innumerable hordes of demons will enslave the\r\nhuman world. But seven brave heroes have already gathered on the top of\r\na mountain Arreat to protect us mere mortals from the effect of this\r\nterrible evil.The seven great heroes are: amazon , barbarian , sorceress\r\n, druid , necromancer , paladin and a professional hit girl . Heroes\r\nalready know how much experience will be given for each of the three\r\nmegabosses: for Mephisto, for Diablo and for Baal.Here\u2019s the problem:\r\nheroes are as much as seven and megabosses are only three! Then our\r\nheroes decided to split into three teams, where each team will go to\r\ndestroy their own megaboss. Each team member will receive a of\r\nexperience, rounded down, where will be the amount of experience for the\r\nkilled megaboss and the number of people in the team.Heroes do not want\r\nto hurt each other\u2019s feelings, so they want to split into teams so that\r\nthe difference between the hero who received the maximum number of\r\nexperience and the hero who received the minimum number of experience\r\nwere minimal. Since there can be several divisions into teams, then you\r\nneed to find the one in which were maximum.It is known that some heroes\r\nlike others. But if hero likes hero , this does not mean that the hero\r\nlikes hero . No hero likes himself.The total amount of liking in teams\r\nis the amount of ordered pairs , such that heroes and are in the same\r\ngroup, and hero likes hero (but it is not important if hero likes hero\r\n). In case of heroes and likes each other and they are in the same\r\ngroup, this pair should be counted twice, as and .A team can consist\r\neven of a single hero, but it is important that every megaboss was\r\ndestroyed. All heroes must be involved in the campaign against evil.\r\nNone of the heroes can be in more than one team.It is guaranteed that\r\nevery hero is able to destroy any megaboss alone.\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <cstdio>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <set>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <string>\n#include <map>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <bitset>\n#include <queue>\n#include <sstream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define mp make_pair\n#define pb push_back\n#define rep(i,n) for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n#define re return\n#define fi first\n#define se second\n#define sz(x) ((int) (x).size())\n#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()\n#define sqr(x) ((x) * (x))\n#define y0 y3487465\n#define y1 y8687969\n\ntypedef vector<int> vi;\ntypedef long long ll;\ntypedef long double ld;\ntypedef pair<int, int> ii;\ntypedef vector<ii> vii;\ntypedef vector<string> vs;\ntypedef vector<vi> vvi;\n\ntemplate<class T> T abs(T x) {\n    re x > 0 ? x : -x;\n}\n\nconst string name[7] = {\"Anka\", \"Chapay\", \"Cleo\", \"Troll\", \"Dracul\", \"Snowy\", \"Hexadecimal\"};\n\nint n;\nint m;\nint g[7][7];\nint ans, res, p[7], x[3], y[3];\n\nint get (string s) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)\n        if (name[i] == s)\n            re i;\n    re 0;\n}\n\nint go (int i) {\n    if (i == 7) {\n        int y[3];\n        memset (y, 0, sizeof (y));\n        for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)\n            y[p[i]]++;\n        if (y[0] * y[1] * y[2] == 0) re 0;\n        int mn = min (x[0] / y[0], min (x[1] / y[1], x[2] / y[2]));\n        int mx = max (x[0] / y[0], max (x[1] / y[1], x[2] / y[2]));\n        int smp = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)\n            for (int j = 0; j < 7; j++)\n                if (g[i][j] && p[i] == p[j])\n                    smp++;\n        if (mx - mn < ans || mx - mn == ans && res < smp) {\n            ans = mx - mn;\n            res = smp;\n        }\n        re 0;\n    }\n    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\n        p[i] = j;\n        go (i + 1);\n    }\n    re 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cin >> n;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        string a, b, c;\n        cin >> a >> b >> c;\n        g[get (a)][get (c)] = 1;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) cin >> x[i];\n    ans = 2e9 + 1;\n    res = 0;\n    go (0);\n    printf (\"%d %d\\n\", ans, res);\n    return 0;\n}"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "implementation"], "dificulty": "1400", "interactive": false}
