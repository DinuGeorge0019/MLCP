The journalists\u2019 experiment\r\nwill last for m days. It is known that at midnight before the first day\r\nof the experiment, there were s_j lost pieces of luggage in the j-th\r\nairport. On the i-th day, the following occurs: , 2n flights take off\r\nsimultaneously, including n flights of the and n flights of the . The\r\nj-th flight of the first type flies from airport j to airport (((j-2)\r\nbmod n )+ 1) (the previous airport, with the first airport being the\r\nlast), and it can carry no more than a_{i,j} lost pieces of luggage. The\r\nj-th flight of the second type flies from airport j to airport ((j\r\nbmod n) + 1) (the next airport, with the last airport being the first),\r\nand it can carry no more than c_{i,j} lost pieces of luggage. , a check\r\nof lost luggage is conducted at the airports.

For each k from 1 to m, the\r\njournalists want to know the maximum number of lost pieces of luggage\r\nthat may be during the checks over the first k days.
