Having returned to the\r\ncastle, Twilight Sparkle became interested in the dice that were used in\r\nthe game.The dice has faces: the first face of the dice contains a dot,\r\nthe second one contains two dots, and so on, the -th face contains dots.\r\nTwilight Sparkle is sure that when the dice is tossed, each face appears\r\nwith probability . Also she knows that each toss is independent from\r\nothers. Help her to calculate the expected maximum number of dots she\r\ncould get after tossing the dice times.\r\n",
