Gleb and Boating", "statement": "Programmer Gleb frequently visits the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\" to participate\r\nin programming training sessions.Not only is Gleb a programmer, but he\r\nis also a renowned rower, so he covers part of his journey from home to\r\nthe campus by kayaking along a river. Assume that Gleb starts at point 0\r\nand must reach point s (i.e., travel s meters along a straight line). To\r\nmake the challenge tougher, Gleb has decided not to go outside the\r\nsegment [0, s]. The dimensions of the kayak can be neglected.Gleb is a\r\nstrong programmer! Initially, his power is k. Gleb\u2019s power directly\r\naffects the movement of his kayak. If his current power is x, then with\r\none paddle stroke the kayak moves x meters in the current direction.\r\nGleb can turn around and continue moving in the opposite direction, but\r\nsuch a maneuver is quite challenging, and after each turn, his power\r\ndecreases by 1. The power can never become 0 if his current power is 1,\r\nthen even after turning it remains 1. Moreover, Gleb cannot make two\r\nturns in a row after each turn, he must move at least once before making\r\nanother turn. Similarly, Gleb cannot make a turn immediately after the\r\nstart he must first perform a paddle stroke.Gleb wants to reach point s\r\nfrom point 0 without leaving the segment [0, s] and while preserving as\r\nmuch power as possible. Help him given the value s and his initial power\r\nk, determine the maximum possible power he can have upon reaching point\r\ns.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["brute force", "constructive algorithms", "data structures", "dp", "graphs", "greedy", "math", "number theory", "shortest paths"], "dificulty": "2300", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV3\\G.
