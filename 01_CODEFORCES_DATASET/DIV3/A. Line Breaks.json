    "editorial": "An important condition in the problem: we can take words on the first\r\nline from the beginning and we cannot skip any word.The main idea is to\r\ncompute the total length of words as we keep adding them, and stop when\r\nwe reach a word where adding the next word would exceed the capacity of\r\nthe first strip (which equals ).It is important to take into account the\r\ncase when all words can be placed on the first line or none will fit,\r\nbut our solution takes this into account.\r\n",

    "statement": "Kostya has a text s consisting of n words made up of Latin alphabet\r\nletters. He also has two strips on which he must write the text. The\r\nfirst strip can hold m characters, while the second can hold as many as\r\nneeded.Kostya must choose a number x and write the first x words from s\r\non the first strip, while all the remaining words are written on the\r\nsecond strip. To save space, the words are written without gaps, but\r\neach word must be entirely on one strip.Since space on the second strip\r\nis very valuable, Kostya asks you to choose the maximum possible number\r\nx such that all words s_1, s_2,\r\ndots, s_x fit on the first strip of length m.\r\n",
