After a\r\nwhile, he stumbled upon a goblin village.Since Akito had nowhere to\r\nlive, he wanted to find out the price of housing. It is well known that\r\ngoblins write numbers as a string of characters \u2019-\u2019 and \u2019_\u2019, and the\r\nvalue represented by the string s is the number of distinct\r\nsubsequences^{\r\ntext{ }} of the string s that are equal to the string \"\" (this is very\r\nsimilar to goblin faces).For example, the string s=\"\" represents the\r\nnumber 6, as it has 6 subsequences \"\": s_1+s_2+s_3 s_1+s_2+s_4\r\ns_1+s_2+s_6 s_1+s_5+s_6 s_3+s_5+s_6 s_4+s_5+s_6 Initially, the goblins\r\nwrote a random string-number s in response to Akito\u2019s question, but then\r\nthey realized that they wanted to take as much gold as possible from the\r\ntraveler. To do this, they ask you to rearrange the characters in the\r\nstring s so that the value of the number represented by the string s is\r\nmaximized.^{\r\ntext{ }}A subsequence of a string a is a string b that can be obtained\r\nby deleting several (possibly 0) characters from a. Subsequences are\r\nconsidered different if they are obtained by deleting different sets of\r\nindices.\r\n", "solutions": [], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["combinatorics", "constructive algorithms", "strings"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false, "file_name": "D:\\scoala\\RESEARCH\\MLCP\\01_CODEFORCES_DATASET\\DIV3\\B.
