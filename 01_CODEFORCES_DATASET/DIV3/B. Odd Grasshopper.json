Making a jump from a point with coordinate x\r\nwith a distance d to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a\r\ncoordinate x - d, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a\r\ncoordinate x + d.The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so\r\nfor each integer i starting with 1 the following holds: exactly i\r\nminutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly i.\r\nSo, in the first minutes he jumps by 1, then by 2, and so on.The\r\ndirection of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the\r\ngrasshopper was before the jump has an coordinate, the grasshopper jumps\r\nto the , he jumps to the .For example, if after 18 consecutive jumps he\r\narrives at the point with a coordinate 7, he will jump by a distance of\r\n19 to the right, since 7 is an odd number, and will end up at a point\r\n7 + 19 = 26. Since 26 is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper\r\nwill make to the left by a distance of 20, and it will move him to the\r\npoint 26 - 20 = 6.Find exactly which point the grasshopper will be at\r\nafter exactly n jumps.\r\n",
