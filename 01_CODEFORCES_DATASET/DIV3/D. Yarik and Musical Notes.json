    "name": "D. Yarik and Musical Notes",
    "statement": "Yarik is a big fan of many kinds of music. But Yarik loves not only\r\nlistening to music but also writing it. He likes electronic music most\r\nof all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his\r\nopinion, is best for it.Since Yarik also likes informatics, in his\r\nsystem notes are denoted by integers of 2^k, where k\r\nge 1 a positive integer. But, as you know, you can\u2019t use just notes to\r\nwrite music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of\r\ntwo notes (a, b), where a = 2^k and b = 2^l, he denotes by the integer\r\na^b.For example, if a = 8 = 2^3, b = 4 = 2^2, then the combination (a,\r\nb) is denoted by the integer a^b = 8^4 = 4096. Note that different\r\ncombinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination (64, 2)\r\nis also denoted by the integer 4096 = 64^2.Yarik has already chosen n\r\nnotes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their\r\nintegers can be very large, he has written them down as an array a of\r\nlength n, then the note i is b_i = 2^{a_i}. The integers in array a can\r\nbe repeated.The melody will consist of several combinations of two\r\nnotes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes b_i, b_j (i < j)\r\nexist such that the combination (b_i, b_j) is equal to the combination\r\n(b_j, b_i). In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs (i, j)\r\n(i < j) such that b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}. Help him find the number of\r\nsuch pairs.\r\n",
