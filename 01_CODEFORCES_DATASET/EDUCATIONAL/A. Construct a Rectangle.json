Now there are two cases.The\r\nremaining two sticks can be the same. In that case, you can break the\r\nchosen stick into equal parts to make the second equal pair of sticks.\r\nNote, however, that the stick should have an even length, because\r\notherwise the length of the resulting parts wonât be integer.The\r\nremaining two sticks can be different. In that case, the chosen stick\r\nshould have the length equal to their total length, because the only way\r\nto make two pairs of equal sticks is to produce the same two sticks as\r\nthe remaining ones.Overall complexity: per testcase.\r\n",
