Couple Cover", "statement": "Couple Cover, a wildly popular luck-based game, is about to begin! Two\r\nplayers must work together to construct a rectangle. A bag with balls,\r\neach with an integer written on it, is placed on the table. The first\r\nplayer reaches in and grabs a ball randomly (all balls have equal\r\nprobability of being chosen) the number written on this ball is the\r\nrectangle\u2019s width in meters. This ball is not returned to the bag, and\r\nthe second player reaches into the bag and grabs another ball the number\r\nwritten on this ball is the rectangle\u2019s height in meters. If the area of\r\nthe rectangle is greater than or equal some threshold square meters, the\r\nplayers win. Otherwise, they lose.The organizers of the game are trying\r\nto select an appropriate value for so that the probability of a couple\r\nwinning is not too high and not too low, but they are slow at counting,\r\nso they have hired you to answer some questions for them. You are given\r\na list of the numbers written on the balls, the organizers would like to\r\nknow how many winning pairs of balls exist for different values of .\r\nNote that two pairs are different if either the first or the second ball\r\nis different between the two in pair, and two different balls with the\r\nsame number are considered different.\r\n", "solutions": ["/*\nOne, two, three, four, five against one\nFive, five, against one\nSaid one, two, three, four, five against one\nFive, five, five, five, five against one\n\nTorture from you to me\nAbducted from the street\n\nI'd rather be\nI'd rather be with\nI'd rather be with an animal\n\nWhy would you wanna hurt me?
