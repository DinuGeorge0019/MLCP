    "statement": "PizzaForces is Petya’s favorite pizzeria. PizzaForces makes and sells\r\npizzas of three sizes: small pizzas consist of 6 slices, medium ones\r\nconsist of 8 slices, and large pizzas consist of 10 slices each. Baking\r\nthem takes 15, 20 and 25 minutes, respectively.Petya’s birthday is\r\ntoday, and n of his friends will come, so he decided to make an order\r\nfrom his favorite pizzeria. Petya wants to order so much pizza that each\r\nof his friends gets at least one slice of pizza. The cooking time of the\r\norder is the total baking time of all the pizzas in the order.Your task\r\nis to determine the minimum number of minutes that is needed to make\r\npizzas containing at least n slices in total. For example: if 12 friends\r\ncome to Petya’s birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least 12\r\nslices in total. He can order two small pizzas, containing exactly 12\r\nslices, and the time to bake them is 30 minutes; if 15 friends come to\r\nPetya’s birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least 15 slices\r\nin total. He can order a small pizza and a large pizza, containing 16\r\nslices, and the time to bake them is 40 minutes; if 300 friends come to\r\nPetya’s birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least 300 slices\r\nin total. He can order 15 small pizzas, 10 medium pizzas and 13 large\r\npizzas, in total they contain 15\r\ncdot 6 + 10\r\ncdot 8 + 13\r\ncdot 10 = 300 slices, and the total time to bake them is 15\r\ncdot 15 + 10\r\ncdot 20 + 13\r\ncdot 25 = 750 minutes; if only one friend comes to Petya’s birthday, he\r\ncan order a small pizza, and the time to bake it is 15 minutes.\r\n",

Now the\r\nvalue of is always even. If , then for such the answer is equal to the\r\nanswer for , so we can say that . While we can order a small pizza.\r\nEventually the value of will be equal to , or . This means that for any\r\nthere will be a set of pizzas with exactly slices.
