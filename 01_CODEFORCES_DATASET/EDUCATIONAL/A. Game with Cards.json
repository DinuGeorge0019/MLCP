Bob has m cards, the j-th of them has the\r\ninteger b_j written on it.On the first turn of the game, chooses one of\r\nhis/her cards and puts it on the table (plays it). On the second turn,\r\nchooses one of his/her cards , and plays it. On the third turn, chooses\r\none of his/her cards , and plays it, and so on the players take turns,\r\nand each player has to choose one of his/her cards with greater integer\r\nthan the card played by the other player on the last turn.If some player\r\ncannot make a turn, he/she loses.For example, if Alice has 4 cards with\r\nnumbers [10, 5, 3, 8], and Bob has 3 cards with numbers [6, 11, 6], the\r\ngame may go as follows: Alice can choose any of her cards. She chooses\r\nthe card with integer 5 and plays it. Bob can choose any of his cards\r\nwith number greater than 5. He chooses a card with integer 6 and plays\r\nit. Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than 6. She\r\nchooses the card with integer 10 and plays it. Bob can choose any of his\r\ncards with number greater than 10. He chooses a card with integer 11 and\r\nplays it. Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than 11,\r\nbut she has no such cards, so she loses. Both Alice and Bob play .You\r\nhave to answer two questions: who wins if Alice is the first player? who\r\nwins if Bob is the first player?\r\n",
