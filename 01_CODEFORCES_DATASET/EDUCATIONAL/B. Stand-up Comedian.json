When a spectator\r\nhears a joke he/she likes, his/her mood increases by 1. When a spectator\r\nhears a joke he/she doesn\u2019t like, his/her mood decreases by 1. If the\r\nmood of a spectator becomes negative (strictly below zero), he/she\r\nleaves.When someone leaves, Eve gets sad and ends the show. If no one\r\nleaves, and Eve is out of jokes, she also ends the show.Thus, Eve wants\r\nto arrange her jokes in such a way that the show lasts as long as\r\npossible. Help her to calculate the maximum number of jokes she can tell\r\nbefore the show ends.\r\n",

At the same time, let her tell the jokes of the fourth time at the\r\nvery end they will not do any good.Types two and three are kind of\r\nopposites of each other. If you tell jokes of each of them one after\r\nanother, then the moods of both spectators don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use that\r\nto our advantage. Tell the jokes of these types in pairs until one of\r\nthem runs out. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little corner case here, though. If there were\r\nno jokes of the first type, then you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use a single pair because of\r\nthe spectators leaves after one joke.Finally, try to tell the remaining\r\njokes of the same type before the fourth type. So the construction looks\r\nlike with and possibly swapped with each other.Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recover the answer\r\nfrom that construction. After the first type, both moods are . After the\r\nalternating jokes, the moods are still the same. After that, one of the\r\nspectators will have his/her mood only decreasing until the end. Once it\r\nreaches , the show ends.Thus, Eve can tell jokes if . Otherwise, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\r\nalways .Overall complexity: .\r\n"
