Alex, Bob and Carl play in such a\r\nway that there are no draws.Today they have played games, and for each\r\nof these games they remember who was the winner. They decided to make up\r\na log of games describing who won each game. But now they doubt if the\r\ninformation in the log is correct, and they want to know if the\r\nsituation described in the log they made up was possible (that is, no\r\ngame is won by someone who is spectating if Alex, Bob and Carl play\r\naccording to the rules). Help them to check it!\r\n", "solutions": ["#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\n#define itn int\n#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()\n#define make_unique(x) sort(all((x))); (x).resize(unique(all((x))) - (x).begin())\n\n#ifdef ONLINE_JUDGE\n\tinline int pidorand() {\n\t\treturn ((rand() & 32767) << 15) | (rand() & 32767);\n\t}\n\t#define rand pidorand\n#endif\t// ONLINE_JUDGE\n\n#ifdef OLBOEB\n\t#define return std::cerr << __FUNCTION__ << \"\\n\"; return\n#endif  // OLBOEB\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ninline int nxt() {\n\tint x;\n\tscanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\treturn x;\n}\n\nint main() {\n\tint n = nxt();\n\tvector<int> a(n);\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\t\ta[i] = nxt();\n\t}\n\n\tint spec = 3;\n\tfor (int x : a) {\n\t\tif (x == spec) {\n\t\t\tputs(\"NO\");\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t\tspec = 6 - x - spec;\n\t}\n\tputs(\"YES\");\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n"], "input": "", "output": "", "tags": ["implementation"], "dificulty": "900", "interactive": false}
