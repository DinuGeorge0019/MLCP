By easy\r\nconstruction one can deduce that the conditions of and are enough.

Let this range be . From the aforementioned formulas one can\r\nnotice that the restrictions on both and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t depend on the length\r\nitself but only on value of . To be more specific: The lowest and the\r\nhighest values for and will be the following: It is claimed that every\r\nvalue between and exists if the values are valid ( and ).The full proof\r\nabout the given conditions being sufficient and the existence of every\r\nvalue on that range is left to the reader. Some kind of a hint might be\r\nthe suggestion to check how the inequalities change on the transition\r\nfrom some period to .Restrict the values by and to count each answer on\r\nexactly one range of lengths. Finally, the value of is added to the\r\nanswer.The number of ranges with the same is .Overall complexity: .\r\n"
