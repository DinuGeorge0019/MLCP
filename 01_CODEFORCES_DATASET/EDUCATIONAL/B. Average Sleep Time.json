Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the\r\nlast days. So now he has a sequence , where is the sleep time on the -th\r\nday.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to\r\ncalculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help\r\nhim with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to\r\nconsider consecutive days as a week. So there will be weeks to take into\r\nconsideration. For example, if , and , then the result is .You should\r\nwrite a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp\r\nover all weeks.\r\n",
