Suppose the character initially has health h_C and attack d_C;\r\nthe monster initially has health h_M and attack d_M. The fight consists\r\nof several steps: the character attacks the monster, decreasing the\r\nmonster\u2019s health by d_C; the monster attacks the character, decreasing\r\nthe character\u2019s health by d_M; the character attacks the monster,\r\ndecreasing the monster\u2019s health by d_C; the monster attacks the\r\ncharacter, decreasing the character\u2019s health by d_M; and so on, until\r\nthe end of the fight. The fight ends when someone\u2019s health becomes\r\nnon-positive (i. e. 0 or less). If the monster\u2019s health becomes\r\nnon-positive, the character wins, otherwise the monster wins.Monocarp\u2019s\r\ncharacter currently has health equal to h_C and attack equal to d_C. He\r\nwants to slay a monster with health equal to h_M and attack equal to\r\nd_M. Before the fight, Monocarp can spend up to k coins to upgrade his\r\ncharacter\u2019s weapon and/or armor; each upgrade costs exactly one coin,\r\neach weapon upgrade increases the character\u2019s attack by w, and each\r\narmor upgrade increases the character\u2019s health by a.Can Monocarp\u2019s\r\ncharacter slay the monster if Monocarp spends coins on upgrades\r\noptimally?\r\n",

    "editorial": "First of all, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understand how to solve the problem without\r\nupgrades. To do this, it is enough to compare two numbers: and the\r\nnumber of attacks that the character needs to kill the monster and the\r\nnumber of attacks that the monster needs to kill the character,\r\nrespectively. So, if the first number is not greater than the second\r\nnumber, then the character wins.Note that the number of coins is not\r\nvery large, which means we can iterate over the number of coins that we\r\nwill spend on weapon upgrades, and the remaining coins will be spent on\r\narmor upgrades. After that, we can use the formula described above to\r\ncheck whether the character will win.The complexity of the solution is .\r\n"
