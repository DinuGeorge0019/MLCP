There are two buttons on the\r\nbook which allow Vasya to scroll d pages forwards or backwards (but he\r\ncannot scroll outside the book). For example, if the book consists of 10\r\npages, and d = 3, then from the first page Vasya can scroll to the first\r\nor to the fourth page by pressing one of the buttons; from the second\r\npage to the first or to the fifth; from the sixth page to the third or\r\nto the ninth; from the eighth to the fifth or to the tenth.Help Vasya to\r\ncalculate the minimum number of times he needs to press a button to move\r\nto page y.\r\n",
