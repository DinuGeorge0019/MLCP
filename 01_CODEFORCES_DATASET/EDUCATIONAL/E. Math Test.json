Petya believes that\r\nthe of the results for students is equal to\r\nsum\r\nlimits_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the\r\ni-th student has got for the test.Your task is to help Petya find such a\r\npermutation p for which the of the results is maximum possible.

Since the value of is\r\nsmall enough that we can iterate over all options, and choose the one\r\nfor which the sum is maximum.For each student, letâs fix with which sign\r\ntheir total points will contribute to the answer, then will contribute\r\nwith the opposite sign. Now, for the question we can calculate the\r\ncoefficient with which will contribute to the answer. It remains to\r\nchoose such a permutation that the sum is the maximum possible. From\r\nhere we can see that if (for some and ), then must holds, otherwise we\r\ncan swap and , and the answer will increase. This means that we can sort\r\nall questions in ascending order by the value in the array, and assign\r\nthe value in the array to the -th question in ascending order.For some\r\nof options, the permutations we found may be illegal because it can\r\nhappen that we consider the case that some evaluates as , but in the\r\nbest permutation we found for that option, it evaluates as . We can just\r\nignore it because this will never be the case with the option giving the\r\nhighest possible surprise value if this thing happened for some option\r\nto choose the signs of , then, if we flip the signs for the students\r\nsuch that the conditions on them are not met in the optimal permutation,\r\nweâll get a combination of signs that yields a higher surprise value.\r\n",
