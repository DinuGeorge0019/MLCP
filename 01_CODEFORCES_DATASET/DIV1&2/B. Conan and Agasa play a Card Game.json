    "editorial": "Let . Observe that if occurs an odd number of times, Conan can simply\r\nbegin by removing one instance of . If there are any cards left, they\r\nall have the same number on them. Now each player can only remove one\r\ncard in their turn, and they take turns doing so. Since there were an\r\nodd number of cards having on them initially, this keeps continuing\r\nuntil finally, in one of Agasaâs turns, there are no cards left.\r\nHowever, if occurs an even number of times, Conan cannot choose a card\r\nhaving on it because it will leave Agasa with an odd number of cards\r\nhaving . This will result in both players picking cards one by one,\r\nending with Agasa picking the last card, and thus winning. In such a\r\ncase, Conan can consider picking the next distinct largest number in the\r\narray, say . If occurs an odd number of times, then after Conanâs turn\r\nthere will be an even number of cards having and an even number of cards\r\nhaving . If Agasa takes a card having then it becomes the same as the\r\nprevious case and Conan wins. Otherwise, they take turns choosing a card\r\nhaving until finally, on one of Agasaâs turns, there are no cards having\r\nand Agasa is forced to pick a card having . Now it is Conanâs turn and\r\nthere are an odd number of cards having , so it is again the same as the\r\nfirst case and Conan wins.By a similar argument, we can show that if\r\nConan plays optimally, he starts by picking a card having the greatest\r\nnumber that occurs an odd number of times. Conan loses if and only if\r\nthere is no such number, i.e., Conan loses if and only if every number\r\noccurs an even number of times.\r\n",
