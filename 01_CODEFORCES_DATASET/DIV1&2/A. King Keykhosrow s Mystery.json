    "statement": "There is a tale about the wise King Keykhosrow who owned a grand\r\ntreasury filled with treasures from across the Persian Empire. However,\r\nto prevent theft and ensure the safety of his wealth, King Keykhosrow’s\r\nvault was sealed with a magical lock that could only be opened by\r\nsolving a riddle. The riddle involves two sacred numbers a and b. To\r\nunlock the vault, the challenger must determine the smallest key number\r\nm that satisfies two conditions: m must be greater than or equal to at\r\nleast one of a and b. The remainder when m is divided by a must be equal\r\nto the remainder when m is divided by b. Only by finding the smallest\r\ncorrect value of m can one unlock the vault and access the legendary\r\ntreasures!\r\n",
